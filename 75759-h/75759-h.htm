<h2 class="nobreak" id="pre">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> book gives a view of the earth and its inhabitants as
seen through the haze of distance, whether of space or of time.
Its purpose is to present those myths and half-myths of
geography which are loosely and yet significantly called travel
tales. It treats of various countries and races and animals which
are, or were, or might have been. Although their true domain is
the imagination, their supposed domain is, or was, somewhere
on the earth. The Coasts of Illusion, as glimpsed here, are
nowhere the shores of the supernatural.</p>

<p>Always the two tend to merge and the problem has been to
keep them apart. The travel tales of the race have grown
out of, or become entangled with, myths in which men sought to
figure the creation of the world, the journeys of the sun from
dawn to darkness, the conflicts of light with storm and night
and winter, the high places of the gods and their incarnations
and agents. Yet the tales are touched with reality, while the
myths are unearthly.</p>

<p>Ulysses tarried among the Phacakians, and these were a cloud
people; but he skirted the land of the lotus-eaters, and these
were a mundane folk. Who were the lotus-eaters? Achilles
fought with Memnon, son of the Dawn, but also with Penthesilea,
the Amazon queen. Who were the Amazons? Hercules was
of the progeny of Olympian Zeus, but wandering on earth he
passed through the land of the pygmies. Who were the pygmies?
What reality lies back of the fabulous animals and Deformed
Folk that peopled the mountains and deserts?</p>

<p>For thousands of years men accepted the realms and races of
prodigy. It was only about a century ago that these disappeared
from the maps and natural histories. The frontiers of
ignorance had been pushed back so far that the never-never
countries dropped off into the sea. There was no longer room
for the phœnix to flap its wings, the dragon to hiss and roar,
the giants to stalk, the kangaroo-men to hop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span></p>

<p>The countries and creatures of legend passed from the scene
without the parting word that every passing merits, without
even a gesture of farewell. Is it more than a tardy courtesy to
summon them back for a word that shall be both appraisal
and remembrance?</p>

<p>These are the stories wanderers told in hall when the world
was young; and in out-of-the-way places still they tell them,
and men believe. These are stories the lad Raleigh heard along
wharves where sailors in outlandish garb recited the wonders
of countries below the rim of the sea. If one could recapture
Raleigh’s boyish faith, and the faith of ages of listeners before
him, it might still be possible to behold the King of Is in state
beside the menacing ocean, to traverse the streets of the lost
Atlantis, to win to the cities of gold which Spain could not
find, and to repeople the waste places with their strange inhabitants.
So might one achieve the purpose of these pages and
regain a picture of things as they were supposed to be.</p>

<p>This is a survey of the world through the stained glass of
men’s imaginings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c1">Chapter I. The World That Was</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> geography, anthropology, and natural history of this
volume present a world a little different from that which is
outlined in modern text-books and yet one that is familiar. It
is the traditional world of wonder, which until yesterday was
believed to be the real world. A map of it would show the
same continents, and some of the same races of men and
species of animals that are delineated in any atlas of to-day;
but there would be changes. Asia would bear far away into
the unknown spaces of the East. A shadowy continent would
stretch across the open waters of the Indian Ocean. The clouds
and darkness of supernatural terrors, or dimly remembered
fates, would shroud the Atlantic, the Green Sea of Gloom of
the Arab geographers. Looming vaguely in the mists southwest
of Gibraltar one would discern a lost continent. One would
see there, also, smaller bodies of land which on a second glance
are seen no more.</p>

<p>Within the contours of continents and islands there would
be countries which seem to belong both to fable and to fact.
The Incense Kingdom would be there on both sides of the Red
Sea, but its sumptuous ritual and swooning odors would suggest
little now to be found in southern Arabia and Somaliland.
The Spice Islands would be there, but wearing the splendor
of a world-desire of which no trace is left to the Moluccas.
There would be seen the haughty realm of Prester John and
the vast pastures of Gog and Magog; but on a modern map of
Asia one does not find the country of the priest king and must
look under other names for the terrifying races of Hebrew
and Moslem legend.</p>

<p>On the map would appear the gold port of Ophir and the
golden land of Havilah, but the Arab haven was silted up ages
ago, and the abandoned mine-workings of Rhodesia minister
no more to the pride of kings. The Arcadia that it would picture,
of pastoral innocence and bucolic song, has faded from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the central uplands of the Morea, and the rugged mountain land
hears no longer the pipes of Pan. There are other regions of
enchantment—deserts where demon-voices tempted the traveler
from his track, mountains where cymbals clashed and lights
gleamed at night, countries of serene charm which were placed
so far away that few people ever reached them. Of these
regions the modern maps know nothing.</p>

<p>If the map of the traditional world were pictorial, as such
maps ought to be, it would show strange races of men in Asia,
in Africa, in South America, in the sea-washed islands, and in
the seas themselves. There would be Amazons sweeping down
upon the Mediterranean settlements, pygmies battling with
cranes in Upper Egypt, satyrs pursuing women in African
woodlots, troglodytes of Arabia looking on with indifference
while strangers maltreated their offspring. The vistas of Asia
and Africa would disclose men taking their siestas beneath the
shade of their own gigantic feet, sleeping at night under the
cover of their elephant-like ears, supporting life by smelling
flowers rather than eating food. Sixteenth-century charts of the
Spanish Americas would reveal the unsuspected fact that these
creatures dwelt also in the new world, and that mermaids sang
upon its coasts, as upon those of the old.</p>

<p>A pictorial map of the traditional world would show that it
was a menagerie of strange animals as well as a museum of
prodigious peoples. The lairs and roosts of heraldry would
return their tenants to its blank spaces. The phœnix would be
seen winging its way from Araby the Blest, or mounting its own
funeral pyre in the City of the Sun in Lower Egypt. The
Desert of Gobi would show the griffin, a formidable guard for
its stores of fabled gold. The unicorn would be sketched doing
the elephant to death in the jungles of Asia and Africa. The
baleful glare of the basilisk would be staged in the recesses
of Libya. The dragon’s breath would poison earth and air and
water alike. The harpies and the Stymphalian birds would
raise their shrill clamor beside the brink of sea or marsh.
Among other creatures in the ocean would be depicted the monstrous
orc, the kraken of the northern deeps, and the ubiquitous,
immemorial, and enigmatic sea serpent. The familiar
animals of natural history would share with the fabled creatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
the forests, pastures, and waters of the mimic world of the
map, but the text would point out novel things about them.</p>

<p>A voyage to these strangely peopled countries of the world’s
yesterdays would be a voyage along the bays, gulfs, and promontories
of the human mind in its states of dream.</p>

<p>There are three chambers in the house of the mind. One of
them is a place where pleasant bedtime stories are told. Another
is the art gallery of hope and memory. The third is a
museum where runs the law of topsy-turvy. The name of the
house is Illusion.</p>

<p class="caption1"><i>A Voyage to These Strangely Peopled Countries of the World’s Yesterdays
Would Be a Voyage Along the Bays, Gulfs, and Promontories of the
Human Mind in Its States of Dream</i></p>
</div>

<p>A glance through a few of the older books of travel will
show illusion weaving its careless spells over plain records of
wandering. “We fared on,” says Sindbad, “from sea to sea
and from island to island and city to city in all delight and
contentment, buying and selling wherever we touched, and
taking our solace and our pleasure.” The words prepare the
reader for enchantments. One of the Hakluyt narratives speaks
of “Zanzibar, on the backeside of Africa.” This is geography
somehow touched with magic. When Drake was cruising
around South America, his chronicler recites that on a certain
day “wee had a very sweet smell from off the land.” Simple
as are the words, their quality is dreamlike. The account of
Raleigh’s third voyage to Guiana has this passage: “There
being divers whales playing about our pinnesse, one of them
crossed our stemme and going under, rubbed her backe against
our keele.” The lines unlock the frolic wonder of the sea.</p>

<p>The same quality illuminates reports of other lands and
peoples taken almost at random. The ancient Cimbri, says
Strabo, explained their wandering life and piracy by the fact
that once they had dwelt on a peninsula and had been driven
out by a very high tide. The ancient Getae wept at births and
laughed at funerals; and in the <i>Arabian Nights</i> Abdallah of the
Sea broke off his friendship with Abdallah of the Land, when
he learned that his people mourned rather than rejoiced over
their dead. Purchas tells of a Livonian people, ignorant but
unashamed, that “aske who learne the Hares in the woods their
prayers.” The same writer declares that Ethiopians hold their
color in such estimation that they paint the saints and angels
black, but “the Divell and wicked persons they paint white.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Pinkerton describes a tribe of white Indians east of the Andes,
whose naked and beautiful women use a guttural speech and
emphasize every remark by striking their thighs with great
force. The Eskimos attributed the Northern Lights to the
merriment of the ghosts. A Florida tribe made a cult of the
devil because the Spaniards feared him.</p>

<p>The thing these statements have in common is that perhaps
none of them is quite true, and yet one wishes to believe all of
them.</p>

<p>The shaping influence in the traditional world is the power of
wish. The poets may seem to use it more than other men, and
children more than grown-ups, but it is the province of mankind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c2">Chapter II. The Earth Itself</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Enveloping</span> old stories of legendary lands and peoples as
with an outer husk are beliefs which relate to the world as a
whole. These concern the shape of the earth, the texture of
the heavens, the distribution of land and water, the contours
of continents, and the precise number of islands, countries, and
cities. What they disclose is the instinct of men working
through the apparent confusion of nature toward order. In all
of them is the sense of symmetry, of balance, and because they
are excursions into the unknown, the method of allegory. The
true symmetry of the universe—the great annual journey of the
earth around a sun itself in motion in a firmament so vast that
through the ages the stars seem not to have changed their places—was
not grasped. The result was errors, picturesque sometimes,
sometimes more useful than truth.</p>

<p>Wherever one stands, the meeting line of the sky and earth
forms a circle of which one is the center. This picture shaped
the primitive geography. The earth was a disk and each people
seemed to itself to be at the central point. In Homer it was a
disk surrounded by a river called the Ocean Stream. The
farther shore of this river supported the brazen dome of heaven,
and earth and heaven were kept apart by the pillars which
Atlas bore on his shoulders. Thales taught that the earth
was a sort of drum floating upright in the wilderness of
waters. The ancient Hebrews thought that the earth was a
rising plain which floated like a lotus flower in the waters. The
Tibetans believed the earth to be cone-shaped. The Chinese
thought that all other lands were grouped as islands about their
own. The Celts thought the earth rested on columns and in the
Irish sea-tales various islands are pictured as standing on pillars.
In North America the plains tribes thought that the Rocky
Mountains supported the sky, the Pacific coast tribes conceived
of the earth as an island swimming in the cosmic waters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the Southwestern tribes gave it as many stories as the tallest
of their public dwellings. The Shoshones said the vault of the
sky was a dome of ice against which the rainbow-snake rubbed
its back, and the Haida said that the firmament regularly rose
and fell, the clouds striking the mountains with an audible noise.
According to many Western tribes the canopy of heaven was
pierced with holes at the four cardinal points, and these were
constantly opening and closing; a sky-world like the earth was
beyond, into which swans and shamans could pass. All peoples
believed that the earth was immovable, with the sun revolving
around it. Many thought it rested on the back of some animal—a
buffalo, a tortoise, a catfish.</p>

<p>Sometimes more sophisticated and still more fanciful ideas
were entertained. To one school of Greek thought the world
was a living being and man himself a microcosm, a little world,
as Paracelsus called him. The sun and moon were the two
eyes of the world, the earth its body, the ether its intellect, and
the sky its wings. It was held that the movements of man and
of the world were in exact correspondence; hence astrology,
which interprets the one by the other. To the Venerable Bede
the universe was an egg, the earth its yolk, the water the white
of the egg, the air its membrane, and the encircling fire the shell
or cover of all.</p>

<p>Cosmas took literally the utterance of St. Paul that the tabernacle
was a figure of the world. In an amazing exercise of
ingenuity he found the oblong design, the walls, roof, and
floor, the candlesticks, the Ark of the Covenant, and the table
of shewbread of this Jewish desert booth all repeated in the
shape and furnishings of the universe. His scheme of things
has been compared to a traveler’s trunk, with its body standing
for the earth, the flat tray for the firmament, and the curved
lid for the arch of upper heaven. The effects of day and night
were produced, Cosmas thought, about as they are on the stage.
There was a tall mountain in the north. When the sun went
behind it darkness fell; when the sun came out from behind
it, there was light. This conception lacks both the intelligence
and the poetry of the American Indian myth where
the Sun-Carrier is pictured as hanging the sun on a peg on
the west wall of his lodge and then unrolling in succession the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
robe of dawn, the robe of blue sky, the robe of golden evening
light and the robe of darkness.</p>

<p>The sense of symmetry demanded that the earth should have
a central point, and each country sought it somewhere in its
own borders. Homer thought that this was on Mount Olympus,
where the Greek gods dwelt. The Hindus thought that it was
on Mount Meru, where their own gods dwelt. The Chinese
fixed it on Mount Sumeru on a circle of gold and with the sun
and moon revolving around it; this was surrounded by the seven
sacred mountains, the seven seas, and the four inhabited continents.</p>

<p>Christian pilgrims said that Jerusalem was in the center of
the earth, quoting the Psalm, “For God is my King of old,
working salvation in the midst of the earth.” There was a
spot not far from the place of Calvary which the Lord had signified
and measured, and this was called Compas. It was something
pilgrims could see and touch. For eight centuries the
legend was current, and for three centuries, until nearly the time
of Columbus, it dominated European maps of the world, which
were wheel-shaped, with Jerusalem at the hub.</p>

<p>Among the Eastern nations the sources and courses of rivers
had sometimes a cosmic significance. They flowed from the
center of the earth or from the Terrestrial Paradise. From the
Cool Lake which was in the midst of Asia, to the south of the
Fragrant Mountains and to the north of the Snowy Mountains,
flowed four great rivers, according to the Chinese. The Ganges
issued from the eastern side of the lake through the mouth of
a silver ox, and found the southeastern sea. The Indus issued
from the southern side through the mouth of a golden elephant,
and found the southwestern sea. The Oxus issued from the
western side through the mouth of a horse of lapis lazuli, and
found the northwestern sea. The River of China issued from
the northern side through the mouth of a crystal lion, and found
the northeastern sea.</p>

<p>In the Genesis story a river goes out of Eden to water the
garden and divides into four—Pison, which compasses the
golden land of Havilah; Gihon, which compasses Ethiopia; Hiddekel,
which goes toward the east of Assyria; and Euphrates.
Josephus, the Romanized Jew, assimilated the Hebrew geography<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
with the Greek account of an Ocean Stream that flowed
around the earth. This encircling river, he said, was the source
of the four biblical streams. The Arabs also accepted the rivers
of Eden and showed ingenuity in tracing their courses to the
distant lands where flowed the streams they had identified with
them. So did John Marignolli, the fourteenth-century Franciscan
traveler.</p>

<p>Paradise, he said, was in Ceylon, about forty miles distant
from Adam’s Peak, which he visited. On this latter peak was
Adam’s footprint and the garden he tilled when expelled from
the abode of innocence. The Mount of Eden overtopped it,
and almost always the mists brooded there, but one could hear
the waters falling from the sacred fount out of which the four
rivers came. These flowed away from the island of Ceylon by
channels under the ocean, the Gihon becoming the Nile, the Pison
passing through India and China, and doubling back through the
deserts to die in the sands and be born again as the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>With the greater portion of the earth unknown, a curious
custom obtained of using definite figures in default of definite
facts. Dicuil, the Irish scholar, said that there were 2 seas, 72
islands, 40 mountains, 65 provinces, 281 towns, 55 rivers, and
116 peoples; he had read this in what he called the cosmography
of Julius Cæsar and Mark Antony. Idrisi declared that there
were 27,000 islands in the Atlantic. Mariners on the Sea of
China told Marco Polo that it contained precisely 7,440 islands,
mostly inhabited. In the Indian Ocean, he said, there were
12,700 islands. The Koreans had an old tradition that there
were fourscore and four thousand several countries upon the
earth, but themselves doubted it. The sun could not warm so
many lands, they thought. Their real belief was that there were
but twelve kingdoms or countries. When the Dutch explorers
named other countries to them they laughed; the visitors must
be talking of towns and villages.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sense of symmetry, sometimes poetic instinct
and the desire for graphic imagery, led men to give the habitable
world the outlines of animate or inanimate objects. Strabo
likened it to a chlamys, or soldier’s cloak. Dionysius Afer
said it was like a sling. The California Indians said it was
like a mat with the long way north and south. Massoudy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
likened it to a bird. The head of the bird was at Mecca and
Medina, Africa was its tail, Irak and India its right wing, and
the land of Gog and Magog its left wing. Other writers pictured
the earth in the semblance of a man, with the head in the
southern hemisphere, and the feet or under part in the northern;
the right hand was the east, whence began the movement of the
<i>primum mobile</i>, and the left the west, whither it trended.
As the head was the noblest part, governing the rest of the body,
so Ptolemy thought, the southern hemisphere was nobler than
the other parts of the earth, and the stars above it were more
resplendent and of greater virtue than those of the northern.</p>

<p>The tides were the breath of the living earth, Solinus thought.
A large man on the beach of the ocean gets up and sits down
twice a day, said the Tahltan Indians of Canada; twice a day
a colossal crab comes out of and goes back to its cave at the foot
of the world-tree, said the Malays; for six hours a serpent at
the rim of the world draws in its breath and for six hours
lets it out, said the Scotch islanders—wherefore the tides ebb
and flow. The Gauls endowed them with life and attacked them
with weapons.</p>

<p>Ptolemy pictured Great Britain as a Z written backward.
Strabo compared Spain to an ox hide. Numantianus likened
Italy to an oak leaf. India was thought to be an exact equilateral
triangle.</p>

<p>There were conflicting views as to the south. Although by the
beginning of the historical period the Sabæans and Phœnicians
had gone down the eastern coast of Africa through the Indian
Ocean some twenty degrees beyond the equator to seek the gold
of Havilah, these ventures into the zone of torrid heat were not
for the Atlantic and the peoples of the west. The insidious
fictions of the Semitic mariners had awakened their fears. No
man, they thought, could live in the lands of vertical sunlight.
In what lay beyond these, they had as little interest as men have
now in the possible populations of other planets. Europeans
of the early Christian era put aside the notion which enlightened
Greeks had entertained that there might be “opposite peoples of
the south.” Assuming the inhuman heat of the torrid zone, it
was evident that a tropical people could not be of the race of
Adam, and heresy was in the thought of any other lineage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Lactantius, the Christian Cicero of the third century, is remembered
because he gave popular error rhetorical expression
and because his words were flung at Columbus twelve centuries
afterward, when he appeared before the Council of Salamanca
to justify his theory that one might reach the east by sailing
west. “Can any one be so foolish,” asked Lactantius, “as to
believe that there are men whose feet are higher than their
heads, or places where trees may be growing backward or rain
falling upward? Where is the marvel of the hanging gardens
of Babylon, if we are to allow of a hanging world at the Antipodes?”
Pliny had answered him with another question two
centuries before. “If any one,” he said, “should ask why those
situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly ask in return,
whether those on the opposite side do not wonder that we do not
fall.”</p>

<p>Even when the ancient world had accepted the theory that the
earth was a sphere, this seemed to it somehow half as long again
from east to west as from north to south, and the belief is preserved
in the two terms, Longitude and Latitude. The limits of
the habitable earth were Thule, or Iceland, to the north; Taprobane,
or Ceylon, to the east; the Aromatic Cape, to the south,
and the Sacred Promontory in Portugal to the west. North of
Thule it was too cold, and south of the Cape of Spices it was too
hot, to support life.</p>

<p>All that the ancient world knew of geography was gathered
up by Ptolemy and systematized in a scheme which among
learned men was the standard of belief for fourteen centuries
afterward. This great Egyptian of the second century eliminated
errors, corrected reckonings, and brought his science
abreast of facts which traders had gathered. He made, however,
three great errors, each, as it proved, more useful than the truth
would have been. Ptolemy estimated the circumference of the
earth as one-sixth less than the fact, although Eratosthenes had
already reached the correct figure. Thus the true sailing distance
from Spain west to Asia was reduced by about 4,000 miles and
the later venture of Columbus made to seem a task less formidable.
Ptolemy also gave Asia a vast extension eastward, further
reducing the apparent distance of a westward route from Europe
to the Orient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>His third error was to assume that another continental mass
joined the southern extension of Africa with a southeastern extension
of Asia, completely landlocking the Indian Ocean. This
was the Terra Australis Incognita of the older charts. It seemed
to be needed to balance the land masses of the northern hemisphere
and satisfy the persistent demand of the mind for symmetry
in the arrangement of the earth. This vast domain has
disappeared from the maps, but its name and part of its area
are preserved in the island continent of Australia. Thus Ptolemy
anticipated the discoveries of the Portuguese, Dutch, and English.</p>

<p>Much of what Ptolemy knew succeeding ages forgot. The
mediæval conception of the world was that of a T within an O
with the east at the top of the circle because Paradise was there
and deserved the highest place, and Jerusalem as its center. The
lower half of the circle was divided by the Mediterranean
equally between Europe and Africa, while the upper half was
all assigned to Asia. The Ægean and Red seas, branching to
the left and the right from the head of the Mediterranean, divided
the upper and lower halves of the circle, and these three seas
formed the T within the O. Around all flowed the Ocean
Stream.</p>

<p>Intellectually, this presentation of the habitable earth belongs
in about the ninth century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> rather than the fifteenth century
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>, but the map, like the Ptolemaic geography, was a brief for
discovery. It cut off the south of Africa, and made it seem a
short voyage around it to India, and thereby it encouraged
efforts to open a sea route to the Orient. It immensely extended
Asia to the east, and thereby led Columbus to believe it might
more easily be reached by sailing west. Also, it revived the
reign of fable and made a new world of wonder. There were
blank spaces on the map of Asia. The monkish map-makers
filled them in with pictures of monstrous races and animals
drawn from the classics, from Old Testament imagery, and from
the Arab repertory.</p>

<p>It seemed at last that all the mistakes of geography were in
conspiracy to unlock the unknown half of the world. The apocryphal
book of Esdras had said that the earth was one part
water and six parts dry land. That three-fourths of its surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
was sea, nobody surmised. Marco Polo had moved Zipangu
(Japan) a thousand miles east from its real position by giving
its distance from the mainland of Asia as 1,500 miles instead of
1,500 li—a Chinese measure of about one-third of a mile. In
the map of Toscanelli, on which Columbus counted much, the
Asiatic coast was placed where California is. The Azores were
supposed to lie far west of their true position. Columbus did
not dream that 210 degrees of longitude lay between Lisbon and
Japan by the westward route. He believed that by sailing from
the Azores for about 3,100 miles he would find Zipangu, and
not unknown Florida. “<i>El mundo es poco</i>” (“the world is
small”), he exclaimed, and steered confidently toward the setting
sun.</p>

<p>These great errors made the adventures of the Genoese in the
New World a gorgeous illusion—the vestibule into a past where,
as he thought, other feet had trodden, instead of the threshold
of continents his feet were first to press. To him it seemed only
that he was reading the book of Marco Polo backward. The
gold and aromatics of which he found traces were those of the
Golden Chersonese and the Spice Islands of the East. An
Indian tale of a white-robed cacique aroused his hope of an
interview with Prester John. He dispatched a mission, including
a converted Jew who knew Hebrew, Chaldaic, and a little Arabic,
to a chieftain of Cuba, in the hope that thus he might establish
relations with the princely house of Kublai Khan. Presently he
would sail farther and, leaving the tropical islands behind him,
would round the Malay Peninsula, cross the Bay of Bengal and
the Sea of the Arabs, and make his way by land from Ethiopia
to Jerusalem, and by ship from Joppa back to Spain. It was a
soaring dream, yet its wings beat feebly beneath the pinions of
the tremendous reality the man died without comprehending.</p>

<p>Columbus added another chapter to one of the oldest beliefs—the
theory of a world summit. Aristotle had thought that the
highest part of the earth was under the antarctic pole, others
that it was under the arctic pole. Columbus held that it was
under the equator. The earth, he thought, had the shape of a
pear instead of an orange. It seemed to him he knew just when
the globe began to swell toward heaven. This was about a
hundred leagues west of the Azores. There the magnetic needle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
swung from northeast to northwest. The airs became more pure
and genial, the sea grew tranquil. From the climate of oppressive
heat and unwholesome air, the explorer ascended the back
of the sea, as one ascends a mountain toward heaven. The culminating
point was on the Tierra Firma of South America, which
might be approached by way of the Gulf of Paria. Thence
flowed the mighty stream of the Orinoco.</p>

<p>A Spanish historian, excusing this fancy of Columbus, remarks
that mathematicians have since demonstrated that he was
not entirely wrong. The diameter of the earth is twenty-seven
miles greater at the equator than at the poles, and the mountain
country of Ecuador, beyond the headwaters of Orinoco, is the
true world summit, for, of all lands, it lies nearest heaven.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c3">Chapter III. Inanimate Nature</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> progress of knowledge has been an advance from poetry
to prose. In part it has consisted in forgetting the things that
were not so. Through most of the story of mankind everything
was fabulous. There were no inanimate objects at the beginning.
Sticks and stones had a soul. This belief passed, but
some quality of marvel remained—the rhythm of the moon repeated
in things terrestrial; the loves and antipathies of the
plants; the properties of gems to bring good fortune or ill, to
promote fecundity, to test the continence of men and women.
There was an unwieldy mass of topographical legends. Every
township had its shrine, or wonder-working well, or hill or tree
that broke a law of nature. There were strange cures for aches
and pains. Illusion was everywhere. The lumber rooms of
history are stored with traditions in which is the faint fragrance
of faded wonder.</p>

<p>Sea and sky had each their part in the drama of life. To
the Celt the voices of the waves carried warning, or sympathy,
or prophecy. The ninth wave was larger than those before it,
and mystery was in it. It was thought that no man or animal
beside the Gallic sea died with a rising tide. The sun sank into
the ocean with a hissing sound, and there were races on both
sides of the world that heard it. The moon, Pliny said, “is
not unjustly regarded as the star of our life.” All seas were
purified when it was full, the Nile waxed and waned with it,
and sap in trees, and even men’s blood, increased or diminished
with its phases. The time of the rising of the Dog Star
was a sort of zero hour for many things in nature and husbandry.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Table of the Sun</i></p>

<p>There was a Table of the Sun, where the earth itself presided
as host. Herodotus was the first to describe it. He says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
that when Cambyses, the Persian king, was in Egypt, he sent
spies into Ethiopia under the pretense of bearing gifts to court,
but in reality to see if the table were a fact. The spies came
back with various stories—that the Ethiopians drank only milk
and water, that they lived to be one hundred and twenty
years old, that the Fountain of Youth bubbled up in that country,
and that they had seen the Table of the Sun. This was set
by direction of the magistrates in a meadow in the outskirts of
the capital city, and the people of the land said that the earth
itself brought forth the food spread upon the table for all
comers. For a full description one may use with advantage
the idiomatic paraphrase of Purchas:</p>

<p>“Of the Table of the Sunne thus writeth Friar Luys de Urreta:
that the king in a curious braverie, and sumptuous vanitie,
caused there to bee set by night in a certain field store of white
bread, and the choysest wines; hanged also on the Trees great
varietie of Fowles, rost and boyled, and set on the ground,
Mutton, Lambe, Veale, Beefe, with many other dainties ready
dressed. Travellers and hungry persons which came hither
and found this abundance, seeing no bodie which prepared, or
which kept the same, ascribed it to <i>Jupiter Hospitalis</i> his bounty
and hospitality, shewing himselfe a Protector of poore Travellers,
and called this field the <i>Table of the Sunne</i>. The report
hereof passed through the world, and brought many Pilgrims
from farre Countries, to visit the same. <i>Plato</i> the Prince
of Philosophers entred into Aethiopia, led with desire to see
this renowned <i>Table</i> and to eate of those delicacies. The Aethiopians,
since their Christianity, in zealous detestation of Idolatry,
will not so much as name this field, and these ancient
Rites.”</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the legend derives from the system
of dumb trading between civilized and savage peoples which in
Africa antedates history. If this be so, the wheat was supplied
by merchants rather than by the king, the magistrates laid down
the rules for the voiceless market, and the natives, coming after
the merchants had withdrawn, left gold in exchange for what
they took away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Mountain of Lodestone</i></p>

<p>Agib, son of a sultan and by his vicissitudes become the Third
Calendar of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, had embarked with all the royal
fleet on a tour of his provinces. A storm blew them out of their
course, and then by virtue of the iron in the ships they were
drawn irresistibly toward a black mountain or mine of adamant
that loomed before them. They saw upon it a dome of fine brass
and on the dome a brazen horse, carrying a rider who had a
plate of lead on his breast, on which talismanic characters were
graven. Suddenly “all the nails and iron in the ships flew
toward the mountain, where they were fixed, by the violence of
the attraction, with a horrible noise; the ships split asunder, and
their cargoes sunk into the sea,” with all the men save Agib
himself. He gained the shore, climbed to the dome, and slept
there, in his sleep receiving good counsel. The next day he shot
three arrows of lead from a bow of brass at the brazen horse
and its rider. They were toppled over, the sea rose and engulfed
the mountain, and Agib was ferried off to fresh adventures.</p>

<p>Some Bedouin or Persian story-teller of the bazaars may
have added the detail of the heaven-kissing statue and its overthrow,
but the body of the narrative is one of the oldest of
legends. Men have always been curious about the lodestone.
The tale of the magnetic mountain to which ships built
with iron bolts are drawn is found in Aristotle, Pliny, and
Ptolemy, in the Arab geographies, in Chinese writings, and in
the reports of explorers clear to the close of the mediæval
period. Ogier the Dane in the Charlemagne cycle was wrecked
on such a mountain and like Agib was spared for sensuous
delights. In a twelfth-century poem, when the ship of Duke
Ernst entered the Klebermeer, it was drawn to the rock called
Magnes and found itself among “many a work of keels,” over
which the masts rose like a tangled forest.</p>

<p>Ptolemy is the most definite of the early writers. “There are
said to be ten islands,” he says, “forming a continuous group
called Maniolai, from which ships with iron nails are said to
be unable to move away, and hence they are built with wooden
bolts. The inhabitants are reputed to be cannibals.” Dampier,
Gemelli-Careri, and many others identify Maniolai with Manila,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and assume that the magnetic islands were the Philippines;
but Gerini, a sagacious editor of Ptolemy’s eastern geography,
believes they were the Nicobars.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The River Sambation</i></p>

<p>Rising in a pious Jewish fable, first recited in Josephus, the
River Sambation has flowed for eighteen centuries through the
geography of legend. It separated the lost Ten Tribes from
other Jews, or from the subjects of Prester John. Some said it
was in Caucasia, others in Arabia; and from as far east as
China and as far west as Ethiopia it was reported. Josephus
placed it between Raphanea and a district of Agrippa’s kingdom;
it was called the Sabbatic river because it ran only on
Saturdays, its bed being dry the other six days of the week.
Pliny had it, however, that on Saturdays the stream rested.
Much was heard of it in the Middle Ages. Eldad Hadani, a
ninth-century traveler, said it was in the land of Cush. It had
little water, but sand and stones rolled restlessly down its bed
with a noise “like the waves of the sea and a stormy wind”;
on the Sabbath their tumult was stilled and flames surrounded
the river so that none could pass.</p>

<p>The stream was in India, spice groves bordered it, and quantities
of precious stones went down in its billowing sand to the
sea; so said the letter of Prester John. It was fifty days’ journey
inland from Aden, said the Jewish traveler Obadiah di Bertinoro,
for thus Arab traders had told him. A Jewish geographer,
Abraham Farissol, also of the fifteenth century, identified it
with the Ganges. Abraham Yazel, a Jewish scholar of the next
century, told of a bottle filled with its sand, and save on the
Sabbath the sand was in motion. A Christian whom he quoted
had seen the river in the dominions of the Grand Turk. It was
from one to four miles broad, with plenty of water, but dangerous
to navigate because of the rocks and sand that rolled along
with the current: “ships which venture on it lose their way, and
indeed no ship is yet known to have returned safely from this
river.” An Arabian in Lisbon carried an hour-glass filled with
this uneasy sand on Friday afternoons through a street of shops
run by Jews who had professed Christianity. “Ye Jews,” he
exclaimed, “shut up your shops, for now the Sabbath comes.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
The last word from the Sambation was in 1847, when the governor
of Aden told a messenger seeking aid for Jews of the
Holy Land that there was a great Jewish kingdom forty stages
inland, but that the river was not there; it was in China.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Magical Springs</i></p>

<p>Classic mythology peopled lakes, rivers, brooks, and springs
with female divinities of a minor rank known as naiads, who
were endowed with prophetic power and were able to inspire
those who drank of these waters. The belief in the nymphs
waned, but a belief in the singular properties of the waters long
persisted. Many stories relate to the mental effects thereof.
If you drink of a pool in the cave of the Clarian Apollo at
Colophon, says Pliny, you will acquire powers of oracle; but
you will not live long. Ctesias tells of an Indian fountain the
waters of which, when drawn, coagulated like a cheese; if a
little of this were triturated and the powder administered in a
potion, anybody who drank of it would become delirious, rave
all that day, and blab out whatever he had done. Therefore
did the king use this water as the modern drug, scopolamin, has
been used, to detect the guilt of persons accused. In Ethiopia,
according to Diodorus, Semiramis discovered a small lake the
sweet red waters of which impelled people who drank of them
to confess their faults. Pliny recites that at the temple of the
god Trophonius in Bœotia near the river Hercynnus are two
fountains, one promoting remembrance and the other forgetfulness;
one is called Mnemosyne, the other Lethe.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Fountain of the Sun</i></p>

<p>The Fountain of the Sun was rediscovered by a modern
traveler, Belzoni, in the oasis of Jupiter Ammon. He found
that the ruins of the temple of Jupiter Ammon served as a basement
for nearly a whole village, in the vicinity of which was this
famous fountain in a deep well. According to old report it
was warm at midnight and cold at noon. The fact is its temperature
does not vary between night and day, and its apparent
changes are due to the greater or less heat of the surrounding
air, as the day advances or declines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Tree of the Sun</i></p>

<p>Best known of all trees was the Tree of the Sun. This grew
in Persia, and Maundeville says of it: “Within those Deserts
were the Trees of the Sun and of the Moon, that spoke to King
Alexander and warned him of his Death. And Men say that
the Folk that keep those Trees, and eat of the Fruit and of the
Balm that groweth there live well four hundred Year or five
hundred Year, by virtue of the Fruit and of the Balm.” Sir
John said he would have gone toward the trees “full gladly,”
but because of the wild beasts, serpents, and dragons “I trow
that one hundred thousand Men of Arms might not pass the
Deserts safely.” However, Marco Polo passed them safely,
and gives one of his terse descriptions of the tree “called the
tree of the sun and by Christians <i>arbo secco</i>, the dry or fruitless
tree.” It looked like the chestnut, but its husks contained no
fruit, and probably it was the Oriental plane tree. Here Alexander
fought Darius.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Wonder-working Trees</i></p>

<p>Ctesias has a characteristic traveler’s account of the parebon,
an Indian tree about the size of the olive, but with neither
flowers nor fruit. It has, however, fifteen thick roots, which,
like the diviner’s rod, will attract the precious metals. If a
cubit’s length of root be taken, says the Cnidian, “it attracts
lambs and birds, and with this root most kinds of birds are
caught.” If you cast it into wine, it solidifies the liquor so that
it can be held in your hand like a piece of wax.</p>

<p>The ancients had much to say of the properties of other trees
and plants. It was thought that the laurel or bay tree was
never struck by lightning, and so the peasants of the Pyrenees
hold to this day; the Emperor Tiberius wore a laurel wreath
during thunderstorms. The oak, planted near the walnut, would
perish. The shadow of the walnut was injurious to men and
productive of headache. The shadow of the elm was refreshing.
The olive, if so much as licked by a she-goat, became barren.
There was a moral feud between the vine and the cabbage, and
between the vine and the radish, so that the latter was prescribed
for drunkenness. The virtue of the mistletoe, says Pliny, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
to resist all poisons and make fruitful any that used it. The
cocoanut and the betel nut were powerful aphrodisiacs. The
gum of the camphor tree bred impotency. The smell of the basil
begat scorpions in the brains of men. Moly would neutralize
sorcery. There was a plant called the eriphia with a hollow
stem, inside of which was a beetle which kept ascending and
descending its narrow home the while it bleated like a kid; this
plant was beneficial to the voice.</p>

<p>The fable of the deadly upas, or poison tree of Macassar,
Erasmus Darwin’s “hydra tree of death,” is modern. According
to tradition, a putrid stream flows from the roots of the tree,
which grows in Java, and the vapors thereof kill. Foersch, a
Dutch physician who published a book in 1783, is mainly
responsible for the ill repute of this tree. He declares that
“not a tree nor blade of grass is to be found in the valley or
surrounding mountains. Not a bird or beast, reptile or living
thing lives in the vicinity.” He even asserts that “on one occasion
sixteen hundred refugees encamped within fourteen miles
of it, and all but three hundred died within two months.”
Investigation has disproved all of this. The tree grows in a
region where vegetation is luxuriant, men make a garment of
its fiber and walk under its branches, and there birds roost.
The venom known as Macassar poison with which Malays tip
their arrows is, however, made from its gum.</p>

<p>There grows on the island of Hierro in the Canaries a remarkable
tree, if one may credit Richard Hakluyt and others of his
time. Hierro is six leagues in circuit and produces ample foodstuffs
for its inhabitants and their flocks of goats, although no
rain falls and no springs gush. There is, however, a great stone
cistern standing at the foot of a tree with leaves like the olive’s.
Clouds hover over the tree “and by means thereof,” says Hakluyt,
“the leaves of the sayd tree continually drop water, very
sweet, into the sayd cisterne, which cometh to the sayd tree from
the clouds by attraction.”</p>

<p>The rain tree of Peru is described as tall, rich in leaves, and
possessed of “the power of collecting the dampness of the atmosphere
and condensing it into a continuous and copious
supply of rain.” “In the dry season,” says a Spanish newspaper
quoted in Walsh’s <i>Handy Book of Curious Information</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
“when the rivers are low and heat great, the trees’ power of
condensing seems at the highest and water falls in abundance
from the leaves and oozes from the trunks. The water spreads
around in veritable rivers. These rivers are canalized so as to
regulate the course of the water.” This singular statement
closes with an estimate that a Peruvian rain tree will yield
nine gallons of water a day, and that 10,000 trees producing
daily 385,000 liters of water can be grown on a square kilometer.</p>

<p>The Weather Bureau at Washington examined (1905) the
facts as to the rain tree, and declared that such a tree never
existed. The American consul-general at Callao reported
(1911) that he could find no rain trees in Peru. Then the Department
of Agriculture made a statement that the rain-tree
legend was centuries old, but had no basis. In partial explanation
thereof an English botanist said that cicada-swarms, settling
upon trees, tap their juices, which fall on the ground.</p>

<p>Australia has planted many so-called rain trees.</p>

<p>Ulloa, the Spanish astronomer, brought back to Europe a
related story in 1736. He found at Quito, he said, a species
of cane from thirty-five to fifty feet high and half a foot
thick. Until the canes reach full size most of the tubes contain
a quantity of water, and this rises and falls and is clear or
turbid, according to the phases of the moon.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Mandrake Myth</i></p>

<p>Legends of the mandrake are perhaps a legacy of the ancient
dark white race whose gloomy imaginings and orgiastic practices
survived to color the brighter religions of Greece and
Rome, and emerged again in the witch-burnings of the Middle
Ages. These legends are widespread, uniformly sinister, often
obscene. Their basis may be in homeopathic magic—the belief
that like cures like, and also may kill like; or it may be in the
sea, where affinities with the pearl myth have been noted. It is
possible that the mandrake of forbidding fable is just a stranded
cowry, the shell which has been called the first deity.</p>

<p>The mandrake is a member of the potato family growing in
Mediterranean countries. It is an emetic, a purgative, a narcotic
poison. Usually its flesh-colored roots are forked, so that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
like a transplanted carrot or parsnip, it resembles a miniature
human figure. On this resemblance, and on its sleep-producing
properties, men have thought that the legends were based, and in
China, ginseng, which also has man-like roots, has inherited
them. The possessor of the mandrake could win good luck for
himself, bring bad luck to others, sway the passions, and even
in some measure command the elements.</p>

<p>Hence the popular notions that the mandrake was an aphrodisiac,
that it relieved barrenness and promoted pregnancy, as
in the triangular episode in Genesis in which Jacob, Rachel, and
Leah figured; it was known as the love-apple, and Venus was
called Mandragorotis, while the Emperor Julian wrote Calixenes
that he drank its juices as a love potion. Hence, also, the belief
that it dripped blood when pulled from the earth and, as Homer
says, emitted a deathly shriek fatal to the man who heard it;
according to Josephus it was the custom in a certain Jewish
village to use a dog to pull up the roots, the dog being killed
by the shrieks that followed. Grimm describes this process,
which consisted in Germany of loosening the soil about the root,
tying the root to the dog’s tail, retreating to a safe distance down
the wind, and then decoying the dog with a piece of bread. The
dead canine was buried on the spot with religious honors,
and the root “washed with wine, wrapped in silk, laid in a
casket, bathed every Friday, and clothed in a little new white
smock every new moon. If thus considerately treated, it acts
as a familiar spirit, and every piece of coin laid by it at night
doubles in the morning.”</p>

<p>Thus the mandrake legend entered its mediæval phase of
devil worship. The root was used as a charm against nightmare,
and against robbers, and to locate buried treasure. It was
supposed to be a living creature “engendered,” as Thomas Newton
says, “under the earth of the seed of some dead person
put to death for murder,” or, as Grimm says, “growing up beneath
the gallows from which a thief is suspended.” Heads
were carved on the mandrakes and these elaborated images went
by the names of manikin and erdman, or earth-man. As much
as twenty-five ducats in gold was paid for them. They were
often carried on the person in bottles, and bottle imps were
credited with the magic powers of homunculi. But if a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
died with one of these upon his person, the devil owned him
forthwith. Joan of Arc was charged with carrying such an
image about with her, but replied that she did not know what a
mandrake was. Margaret Bouchey was hanged near Orléans
in 1603 on the ground that she kept a living mandrake fiend,
in form of a female ape.</p>

<p>Mandrake manikins were counterfeited from the root of a
yam-like plant, which had been manipulated into a complete
likeness of the human body. Sir Thomas Browne describes the
process: “The roots which are carried about by imposters to
deceive unfruitful women are made of the roots of canes, briony,
and other plants; for in these, yet fresh and virent, they carve
out the figures of men and women, first sticking therein the
grains of barley or millet where they intend the hair should
grow; then bury them in sand until the grains shoot forth their
roots, which, at the longest, will happen in twenty days; they
afterward clip and trim those tender strings in the fashion of
beards and other hairy teguments. All which, like other impostures,
once discovered, is easily effected, and in the root of white
briony may be practiced every spring.”</p>

<p>A century ago mandrake images were still seen in French
seaport towns, but now mandragora has lost its vogue even as
a medicine. In Africa and the East, however, it is still used
as a narcotic and anti-spasmodic, while ginseng, which is a
surrogate, maintains its spell in China, where as much as four
hundred dollars has been paid for an ounce of it.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Precious Stones</i></p>

<p>Among minerals jade held a place as distinct as that of the
mandrake among plants, but its associations were all auspicious.
Its place is the highest among the precious stones, although it is
not a precious stone at all. It is a substance to which heliolithic
culture attached magical power and which it carried quite
around the world before history began, Aryans, Kanakas, and
red Indians holding it in equal regard. Axes and hatchets of
jade or jadeite have been uncovered in the burial grounds of
neolithic Europe, and there are jade celts, cylinders, and amulets
bearing Greek, Babylonian, and Egyptian inscriptions. In a
sense the civilization of China has been built up around this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
stone. Eighteen centuries before the Christian era the emperors
of the Shang dynasty used it in the state ritual, paying homage
to the east with a green jade tablet, to the south with a red tablet,
to the west with a white tablet, and to the north with a black
tablet. According to Confucius, “its sound, pure and sonorous,
with its peculiarity of ceasing abruptly, is the emblem of music;
its splendor resembles the sky, and its substance, drawn from
mountain and stream, represents the earth.” An ancient caravan
trade in this stone is commemorated by a portal in the
Great Wall called the Jade Gate.</p>

<p>The Amazon stone which the Spaniards obtained from the
South American Indians was jadeite. By them as well as by
their conquerors it was thought to be a cure for diseases of the
kidneys, hence its name of nephrite. A revived interest in jade
followed American exploration. Historically it has been treasured
as a cure for colic and for diseases of the spleen and loins;
hung against the stomach, Galen believed it a remedy for
cramps. It was a good-luck charm, and, fashioned into drinking
cups, a detector of poisons, which foamed against the brim.
It survives in art and symbolism after having passed out of
magic and medicine.</p>

<p>Many of the old traditions about stones persist in popular
belief, which holds certain kinds of gems and individual jewels
as lucky or unlucky; and in fashion, which assigns to each
month its appropriate birthstone. It was supposed that the
garnet preserved health, that the ruby was a remedy for plague,
that the turquoise protected from accident, that the eagle-stone
would promote childbirth, that the emerald would prevent epilepsy,
that the topaz would cure insanity, that lapis lazuli was
a purgative, and bezoar antidotal. Jasper was a febrifuge and
rock crystal quenched thirst. An amethyst would prevent intoxication,
a bloodstone would confer the gift of prophecy, a
chrysoprase would cure cupidity, a sapphire would defend
against enchantments, an agate would avert a tempest, a carbuncle
would give light in the dark, an opal would dispel
despondency, an emerald would break if worn in the commerce
of the sexes, and a diamond under a woman’s pillow would
discover her incontinency.</p>

<p>In Christian symbolism, jasper signified the foundation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the church, emerald the freshness of piety, beryl the illumination
of the divine spirit. Sapphires typified the heavenly-minded,
chrysolite those who let their light shine in word and
deed, chalcedony those who fast and pray in secret.</p>

<p>However vain the pagan jewel-lore from which Christian
borrowings were made, the ideas it arrays are older than the
conception of precious stones as mere adornment. These things
were sought and worn at first as life-givers and luck-bringers,
and not because they were beautiful. Justinus Kerner is of
those writers who contend that primitive man was so attuned to
nature that “even the spirit of the stone, now grown dull and
sluggish, was capable of affecting him.” Only when persons
are under the influence of magnetism, says this writer, are they
susceptible to the inherent powers of precious stones; because
that state was in a measure the normal state of early men they
found greater medicinal virtue in gems than in roots and herbs.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Wonders of Countries</i></p>

<p>The travelers of yesterday found marvel awaiting them in
every land. The sun of India, Ctesias says, appears to be ten
times larger than in other countries, and for four finger-breadths
downward the surrounding seas are so hot that fish cannot come
near the surface. It is so hot in Ormuz, says Maundeville, that
“the Folk lie all naked in Rivers and Waters, Men and Women
together, from nine o’clock of the Day till it be past the Noon.”
In the Persian city of Susis, says Strabo, “lizards and serpents
at midday in summer cannot cross the streets quick enough to
prevent their being burnt to death midway by the heat.” Setting
one thing against another, Diodorus says that in Scythia by the
force of cold even brazen statues are burst asunder, while “in
the utmost coasts of Egypt and the Troglodytes the sun is so
scorching hot at midday that two standing together cannot see
each other by reason of the thickness of the air.”</p>

<p>Ctesias speaks of a fountain in India which swims every year
with liquid gold, and out of which are drawn a hundred earthen
pitchers filled with the metal—melted ore, suggests Lassen.
There is growing upon Mount Ida in Scandia, says Father
Jerom Dandini, “a herb whose virtue is to gild the teeth of
those animals that eat of it; one may believe, and with good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
reason, that this proceeds from the golden mines which are in
that ground.” Herodotus reports the Thracians as saying that
the country beyond the Ister (Danube) is possessed by bees,
wherefore travelers cannot penetrate it; these may have been
mosquitoes. At the altars of Mucius in the country of the Veii,
and about Tusculum and in the Cimmerian Forest, says Pliny,
there are places in which things that are pushed into the ground
cannot be pulled out again.</p>

<p>Geographical marvel may be brought down almost to date
with Humboldt’s report on the moving “stone of the eyes” in
South America, which the natives believed to be both stone and
animal; and with Irving’s account of the extinct thunderbolts
which the plains Indians told him they sometimes used for arrow
heads. So armed, a warrior was invincible, but he vanished
if a thunderstorm arose during battle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c4">Chapter IV. The Animal Kingdom</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Much</span> of the literature of marvel relates to real animals.
The savage could see no great difference between them and himself;
that their bodies were unlike his did not seem important.
They could reason like him, they could understand what he
said to them, they had souls which, like his own, lived after
death. A beast could assume human shape, a man could become
a beast, and it was totemic theory that some beasts were
ancestors of some men.</p>

<p>There were tribes that acted as if they were beasts, or birds.
The Bororo Indians identified themselves with gorgeous red
birds that lived in the heart of the Brazilian forest, and treated
them as if they were fellow mortals. Travelers have told of
savages who ate maggots bred in the carcasses of animals, and
on ceremonial occasions thereafter writhed, roared, barked, or
grunted, in keeping with the nature of the snake, lion, jackal, or
hippopotamus whose body had been the table of their feast. The
people of an Alaskan island mistook the first Russian party
that landed there for cuttlefish, because the men had buttons
on their clothes.</p>

<p>Abundant traces of a belief that animals were beings of a
higher order than men are found in early religion, magic, and
medicine. Many of them were worshiped. Out of a fear that
their spirits might work harm, all of them were propitiated even
when pursued or killed. Portions of their dead bodies were used
as amulets and to work spells. Their brains, blood, entrails, and
excrements were a principal part of the Roman pharmacopœia
in the most brilliant age of the Empire; the witches’ broth in
Macbeth is an Augustan brew. Along with hundreds of like
prescriptions, Pliny recites that a mole’s right foot and the earth
thrown up by ants are remedies for scrofula, that a bat’s heart
is an antidote for ant venom, that a hen’s brains will cure snake
poison and the owlet’s a bee sting, that profuse perspiration may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
be checked by rubbing the body with ashes of burnt goats’ horns
mixed with oil of myrtle, and that catarrh may be relieved by
kissing a mule’s nostrils.</p>

<p>Curious as these things may seem, they come naturally from
the fact that primitive man had mainly to do with animals.
Outside of his tribal group he knew other men only as enemies.
But all about were furred and feathered and not unfriendly
creatures whose acts had a certainty and finality lifting them
above the doubts and fears that harassed him. He seemed a
late comer and guest in an animal world. So he did what timid
peoples are wont to do. He put himself under the protection
of beings more gifted than himself. He became a vassal of the
beasts. This was the first feudalism.</p>

<p>The savage was glad to assert his kinship with the brute. In
the Indian west it was through the First People, who had the
human shape but an animal nature, and were transformed into
beasts and birds; a beast or a bird then created the second race
of men. The natives of Vancouver Island thought that when
nobody was about animals laid aside their skins and were people.
In places the tradition lingers that migratory birds become
men when in other lands. A traveler far from home was amazed
when a stranger called him by name and asked about each member
of the family. The mystery was solved when he learned how
this intimate knowledge was gained; the stranger was the stork
that each year built its nest upon his roof.</p>

<p>Both in skin-shifting and shape-shifting the blood relationship
between man and brute was avowed. In the one, the hero of
savage epic, by donning or doffing an animal skin, put on or put
off the beast nature. In the other, the human or animal actor
strutted for a space on his cousin’s stage. Wizards could transform
themselves, as men thought, into wolves and hyenas; the
world-wide legend of the werewolf traces from the time when
metamorphosis was the alpha and omega of myth. Its survivals
strew the classics. Io became a heifer, Actæon a stag, Antigone
a stork, Arachne a spider, Itys a pheasant, Philomela a nightingale,
and Progne a swallow.</p>

<p>Animals took on human form to get better acquainted with
men. Indian story tells of a man who unwittingly married a
female buffalo. An Indian woman wedded a stranger who bade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
her always throw the bones in a certain place, and whenever
he went out to eat she heard the barking of a dog near the
bone-heap; that was what he was. There are stories from every
continent of the union of women with reptiles that masqueraded
as men. Perhaps because they can assume the erect posture,
bears were often parties to alliances of this kind. It was thought
in Iceland that they were men bewitched and that their progeny
were born human but turned into cubs at a touch of the dam’s
paw. The Votiaks of the American northwest say the bear
traces back to man and knows his speech. When the hide is off,
the California Indians aver that bears are just like people. In
a Coos Indian story a girl married a fine-looking man whom she
met while picking berries; but when he took her to the ancestral
lodge, she found herself in a bear camp. There is a Tlingit
tale of a hunter who was captured by a female grizzly—object,
matrimony.</p>

<p>The mitigation of these world stories is that they are literalistic
misreadings of old totemistic custom. Yet it is pleasant
enough to learn from a Tahltan tale that caribou “like to be
called people.”</p>

<p>Under totemism, men chose their elder brothers, the brutes,
for guardians, took their names, deposited their own souls with
them for safekeeping, and, after death, entered their bodies.
Where totemism was unknown it was thought that the larger
prowling animals might be tenanted by demons and that their
weird howls at night were incidents of beast debates which had
the destinies of men as their topic. It was well not to affront
them even by naming them; better to use ingratiating epithets,
such as “blue-foot,” “gold-foot,” “gray-beard,” “broad-brow,”
“flash-eye,” “forest-brother.” The lesser sort were rogue heroes
in the beast epics—among the Hottentots the jackal; among the
Bantus, the rabbit; among the Orientals, the fox; among the
American Indians, the turtle, coyote, and raven.</p>

<p>As a memorial of the antique relation between man and beast,
three out of every hundred persons in England and America
bear animal names. There is a wealth of detail as to how that
relation was carried down through legend into history. The
woodpecker directed the Aryan migrations, the wolf suckled the
founders of Rome, the nest of the eagle determined the winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
camps of the legions, the flights of birds fixed the sites of cities,
and their entrails decided for nations the issues of war and
peace. Animal forms range the entire field of early man’s interests.
Deified bulls, rams, crocodiles, hawks, and ibises thronged
the hospitable pantheon of Egypt. In the speculation of various
peoples the snake, the elephant, the whale, the boar, the turtle,
or the catfish supported the world, and when the creature moved
itself earthquake followed. The dove of Hebrew deluge story
found the earth. The larger animals were in the sky as constellations
before history began. When the moon is in eclipse there
are men to believe that it has been swallowed by a snake, a wolf,
a frog, a crab.</p>

<p>In their primitive judicial processes men took oath in the
name of the sacred animal. In their agriculture they conceived
of the life of the grain as residing in an animal corn spirit—a
horse, a pig, a goat, or a dog, which hid itself in the last clump
of grain to be cut. In their marriage ceremonies, the cock,
duck, goat, or goose was a fertility emblem. Totem beasts are
tattooed on the bodies of savages. Animal outlines, at first as
a strong magic, were used upon pottery, clothes, and weapons,
and as decoration are still used. In animal masks and with
magical intent, dances are performed which mimic the ways of
beasts. Their feet, horns, claws, and teeth enter the medicine
bag of the shaman. When at last death comes to the savage,
perhaps a turkey buzzard or a humming bird convoys his soul to
the other world, or a dog guards the bridge over which it is to
pass to a happier realm, where the hunting of animals begins
anew.</p>

<p>The reverence paid to the least considered of animals may
serve to show in what regard all of them were held and to explain
the marvels told about them. Scattered through the literature
and folklore of various peoples is a copious mass of
traditions as to vermin worship and to practices just suggested
by the fact that Beelzebub, the devil of Jewish Scripture, is the
Semitic god of flies. There was a classic deity known as the
mouse-Apollo and tame mice were kept in his sanctuary. The
Philistines sent to Israel, with the captured Ark, golden images
of mice. Isaiah bears witness that certain of the Jews met
secretly in gardens and ate swine’s flesh and mice for sacramental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
purposes. In old stories the soul is pictured as issuing
from the mouths of dying or sleeping persons in the form of
a mouse. The Chams of Indo-China erected a pillar to the god
rat. Herodotus tells of the destruction of an Assyrian army
in Egypt by the aid of mice auxiliaries. It is still the custom
in some districts of Europe for peasants to exorcise mice from
the crops by running wildly with lighted torches around the
fields on the eve of Twelfth Day; to put the milk teeth of
children in a rat runway, so that the second teeth shall be as
white and strong as the rodent’s; to treat white mice with kindness
so as to bring luck to the house, and even to post a writing
with a message of good will where rats and mice can see it.</p>

<p>While domestic animals which had killed or maimed persons
were regularly tried in the criminal courts of ancient Greece and
mediæval Europe, ecclesiastical courts long exercised jurisdiction
over smaller animal offenders. The curse of the Church
was relied upon to reach vermin against which the secular law
knew itself to be powerless; yet anathema was not pronounced
without judicial process. On complaint of ravaged parishes,
field mice, locusts, and beetles were summoned to appear in
court on a certain day and counsel was appointed to defend
them. In defense of accused rats in the diocese of Autun,
Chassenée, the brilliant French advocate of the sixteenth century,
laid the foundations of his fame. He cited biblical and
classical writers, interposed various technical objections, attributed
the failure of his clients to appear to the absence of
safe conducts, and demanded that the plaintiffs give bond that
their cats would not molest the defendant rodents in their journey
to court. On their refusal to give bond the case was adjourned
without day.</p>

<p>Many such cases were compromised by setting aside a plot
of land to which the accused creatures might repair for sanctuary.
In the suit of Franciscan friars in Brazil in 1713 against
white ants which had invaded their monastery, the compromise
was influenced by the plea of counsel that the defendants not
only had prior possession of the ground, but were more industrious
than the complaining monks. Ecclesiastical suits were
brought at various times against caterpillars, cockchafers, flies,
leeches, moles, snails, slugs, weevils, and worms. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
ninth to the nineteenth century there is a record of 144 successful
prosecutions of animals, vermin included, and these are
thought to be only a fraction of the total number of such litigations.
The age which brought them was no less sure that
insects had rights, including the right of subsistence, than that
the Church had effectual power over them.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Elephant</i></p>

<p>About the larger creatures fable has been busy and the foremost
figure is naturally the hugest of the land animals; only with
mediæval and heraldic times did the lion win pre-eminence.
Classic tradition revolves around the elephant’s intelligence,
morality, and social traits. There are stories of its understanding
Greek, and even writing it. As Pliny repeats, “it is sensible
alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree that
is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty, prudence,
and equity; it has a religious respect also for the stars, and a
veneration for the sun and the moon.”</p>

<p>When surrounded by hunters, report had it that elephants
placed themselves in battle line, with the smaller-tusked animals
in front, so that the enemy might see that the spoil was unworthy
the seeking. When they perceived themselves about to be overcome,
they broke off their teeth against a tree in order to pay
their ransom. While other animals avoided fire, they resisted
and fought it because they saw it destroyed the forests. When
worn out by disease, they have been seen lying on their backs
and casting grass up into the air, “as if deputing the earth to
intercede for them with its prayers.”</p>

<p>John Lok, in his <i>Voyage to Guinea</i>, paraphrases an ancient
belief as to the feud between the elephant and what he calls
the dragon: “They have continual warre against Dragons, which
desire their blood, because it is very colde; and therefore the
Dragon lying awaite as the Elephant passeth by, windeth his
taile, being of exceeding length, about the hinder legs of the
Elephant, &amp; so staying him, thrusteth his head into his tronke
and exhausteth his breath, or else biteth him in the Eare, whereunto
he cannot reach with his tronke, and when the Elephant
waxeth faint, he falleth downe on the serpent, being now full
of blood, and with the poise of his body breaketh him: so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
his owne blood with the blood of the Elephant runneth out of
him mingled together, which being colde, is congealed into that
substance which the Apothecaries call Sanguis Draconis, (that
is) Dragons blood, otherwise called Cinnabaris, commonly
called Cinoper or Vermilion, which the Painters use in certaine
colours.”</p>

<p>The elephant is polygamous, although, as Lok says, “Plinie
and Soline write that elephants use none adulterie.” It was
thought that the intercourse of the sexes took place every second
year, in a honeymoon of five days’ length, and that the couples
purified themselves in a river before rejoining the herd. Of
these nuptial journeys Buffon says, “In their march love seems
to precede and modesty to follow them, for they observe the
greatest mystery in their amours.” To this day the East Africans
think that if their wives are unfaithful while they are on an
elephant hunt, themselves will be killed or maimed by their
quarry.</p>

<p>It was a Roman belief that when elephants met a man who
had lost his way in the woods they would go gently before him
and bring him to a plain path. Sindbad had a kindred experience
on his seventh voyage when a herd conducted him to their
cemetery so that henceforth “I should forbear to kill them, as
now I knew where to get their teeth without inflicting injury on
them.” It is still widely believed that somewhere in Central
Africa, perhaps in a remote valley of the western Sudan, is
an elephant graveyard whither all the aged and ailing pachyderms
of the continent repair, sometimes traveling thousands of
miles in order to die in peace amid the relics of their kind. No
elephants dead of natural causes are ever found, tradition avers,
and from time to time expeditions have sought the vast riches
of this storehouse of mortuary ivory.</p>

<p>To the elephant various peoples have accorded royal honors.
Akbar, the great Mogul, erected a monument to a favorite
elephant, which still stands near the deserted city of Fatephur
Sikri; it is a tower seventy-two feet high, studded with hundreds
of artificial tusks. At the court of Siam the traditional rank of
the chief white elephant has been next to the queen and before
the heir-apparent. The chief of the Burmese court herd has the
residence and honors of a minister of state. “The king of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Pegu,” says one of the Hakluyt travelers, “is called the King of
the White Elephants. If any other king have one, and will not
send it him, he will make warre with him for it; for he had
rather lose a great part of his kingdome than not to conquere
him.” This was history when penned. In the sixteenth century
a long war was waged between Pegu, Siam, and Aracan, wherein
five kings were killed, in order to obtain possession of one white
elephant. These albinos are regarded as an appurtenance of
royalty and lack of them is an ill omen. Siam is the Land of
the White Elephant.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Rhinoceros</i></p>

<p>The ancients had less to say of the rhinoceros than of the monoceros
or unicorn, for which fabulous beast it may have provided
the pattern; but they wove legends about the virtues of
its horn and its feud with the elephant. Cosmas Indicopleustes
wrote that when the rhinoceros walked its horn shook, but that
rage tightened it so that the beast was able to uproot trees. Its
skin was four fingers thick, and so hard that from it, instead of
iron, men made plowshares. In later ages the horn was kept
for the cure of diseases and detection of poison. Drinking cups
were made of it on a turner’s lathe, and the mediæval west
accepted the tradition of the east that these would sweat at the
approach of poison. Horns taken from young bull rhinoceroses
which had never coupled with females were preferred. Set in
gold and silver, the goblets were an acceptable present for kings.
Thunberg was one of the first inquirers to put the superstition to
the test by bringing the horn and various poisons together; there
was no chemical reaction.</p>

<p>The tongue, not the horn, of the rhinoceros was its weapon
of offense, according to old belief. Marco Polo says that this
member, in the Sumatran species, is armed with long sharp
spines, wherewith, after trampling its enemies, it licks them to
death. Pliny has a like story.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Hippopotamus</i></p>

<p>Of the hippopotamus two travelers’ tales may be noted. Pliny
gives it on hearsay that the river horse enters a cornfield backward,
so that there will be no one waiting to waylay it when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
comes out. The statement of Father Joano dos Santos in his
history of eastern Ethiopia (1506) may best be set down verbatim:
“The hippopotamus is naturally of a sickly constitution,
and subject to gouty paines, which it cures by scratching the
stomach with the left foot; and it has further been noticed, when
it wishes to effect a perfect cure that it falls on the horn of
the hoof of the left foot; this, entering the stomach, appeases
and terminates the pain. Hence the Caffres and Moors make
use of this horn as a remedy for the gout.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Hyena</i></p>

<p>The foul countenance and abject gaze of the hyena, its misshapen
body, its slinking tread, its affinities with both the wolf
and the cat tribes, have been provocative of legend. It lurks
in caves and ruins by day, it prowls for carrion food at night,
it despoils graveyards of their dead, it roams through unlighted
villages, and its howl when excited has a weird note, as of a
demon’s laughter; so antique fable had much to work upon. “Of
prodigious strength,” Ctesias called the beast under its Indian
name of Krokottas; and, indeed, no animal of its size has jaws
so powerful. He credited it with the courage of the lion, the
speed of the horse, and the strength of the bull. It imitated
the human voice, he said, and, pronouncing their names, called
men out at night, when it fell upon and devoured them. “We
cannot in the least credit this,” is however, the comment of Diodorus
Siculus.</p>

<p>Pliny, and Solinus after him, thought that the hyena was
male one year and female the next—an opinion challenged by
Aristotle. It was supposed to carry a stone in its eye which,
placed under a man’s tongue, would enable him to prophesy.
Purchas says the beast “hath no necke joynt, and therefore
stirres not his necke but with bending about his whole body.”
Improving upon Ctesias, he says the animal draws near to
sheepcotes at night in order to learn the names of herdsmen,
whom afterward it decoys to destruction. Its eyes are “diversified
with a thousand colours” and the touch of its shadow
“makes a dogge not able to barke.” Buffon mentions, only to
scout, the notion that the hyena fascinates shepherds so that they
cannot move, and renders shepherdesses distracted in love. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
a supposed hybrid, Raleigh excludes it from the Ark. A kind of
worship is still paid it in East Africa, where the oath of the
hyena is administered; it is a crime to kill one and a misdemeanor
to mimic its voice. Stories are told of gold rings found
in the ears of dead hyenas similar to those worn by sorcerers
and workers in iron.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Gnu</i></p>

<p>Near the headwaters of the Nile, according to Pliny, roams
the catoblepas, an animal of moderate size and of movements
made cumbersome by a head immoderately heavy, which is
always bent down toward the earth. This is a fortunate thing,
for otherwise “it would prove the destruction of the human
race,” since “all who behold its eyes fall dead upon the spot.”
In this demon-beast of dejected aspect Cuvier recognizes the
antelope-gnu, a horned creature apparently compounded of a
bison’s head, a horse’s body, and an antelope’s legs; a fantastic
and mournful silhouette of the African prairies.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Crocodile</i></p>

<p>The standing of the crocodile in ancient Egypt, and among the
savages of the East Indies to this day, has been that of a sacred,
or at least a tabooed, animal. It had its own temple at Memphis,
where it was worshiped as a divinity, and tame crocodiles took
part in the religious processions. The Dyaks of Borneo and the
Minangkabauers of Sumatra never kill a crocodile unless it has
killed a man. Its privileged position among animals is due to
a variety of reasons, of which only three need be noted: it is a
dangerous reptile, it flourishes mainly where other food is
plenty, and its meat is not agreeable to most palates, having, as
Sir Samuel Baker puts it, “the combined flavor of bad fish, rotten
flesh, and musk.” Such a creature it is both savage superstition
and policy to let alone, and even to flatter.</p>

<p>The older explanations of crocodile worship are more fantastic.
According to Plutarch, this reptile is a symbol of deity because
it is the only aquatic animal which has its eyes covered
with a thin membrane, so that, like divinity, it sees without being
seen. He adds that the Egyptians worship God symbolically in
the crocodile, that being the only animal without a tongue, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
the Divine Logos, which is in no need of speech. One species
has something more than a hundred teeth, wherefore Achilles
Tatius declares, “the number of its teeth equals the number of
days in a year.”</p>

<p>In his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Ludolf saw a crocodile
which the Knights Templars, by extracting certain of its teeth,
had converted into a serviceable beast of burden. “In winter,”
says Maundeville, “the Cockodrills lie as in a dream.” Purchas
provides a detail on a matter of peculiar interest to the mediævals:
one lobe of the crocodile’s liver is poison, the other counter-poison.</p>

<p>“Crocodile tears” are defined as simulated weeping, and back
of this useful metaphor is the venerable tradition set down in
Hakluyt’s collection: “His nature is ever when hee would have
his prey, to cry and sobbe like a Christian body, to provoke them
to come to him, and then hee snatcheth at them, and thereupon
came this proverbe that is applied unto women when they weepe,
<i>Lachrmyæ Crocodili</i>, the meaning whereof is, that as the Crocodile
when hee crieth, goeth then about most to deceive, so doeth
a woman most commonly when shee weepeth.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>Snakes</i></p>

<p>Most of the numerous snake traditions have a religious significance.
The older writers, however, have left observations
which belong to natural history. Pliny recites it as “a well-known
fact” that a serpent 120 feet in length was taken at the
river Bagrada in the Punic Wars by the Roman army under
Regulus. The monster was besieged as if it were a fortress,
balistæ and other engines being used. Of India, known from
earliest time for its immense serpents, the most striking reptile
story Ctesias has to tell is of a snake only a fathom long, and
without fangs. It is purple with a white head and does execution
by vomiting. Flesh putrefies wherever the vomit falls.
Suspended by the tail, it yields two kinds of poison, amber-hued
when the snake is living, black when obtained from a carcass.
A sesame seed’s bulk of the former brings instant death to him
who swallows it, his brains oozing from his nostrils, while the
latter brings death from consumption after about a year.</p>

<p>Out of many traditions that snakes have power to fascinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
or injure without striking, two opinions from respectable sources
may be given. Ulloa, the Spanish explorer, thinks the breath
of the cobra produces “a kind of inebriation,” in persons, as
does “the urine of the fox” and “the breath of the whale.”
Lobo, the Portuguese friar, reports that while lying on the
ground in Abyssinia, he was seized with a pain which forced
him to rise, when he discovered a serpent something more than
four yards from him. He revived himself with “that sovereign
remedy” a bezoar stone. These serpents, he explains, have wide
mouths and swallow air in great quantities, which they presently
eject with such force that it kills at four yards.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Grasshoppers</i></p>

<p>Classic writers knew the grasshopper less as a pest than as
a food, and it has a pleasant place in myth. Tithonus, beloved
of Aurora and dowered by the gods with immortality but not
with eternal youth, was changed by her into a grasshopper after
he shrank up with old age. There is a grasshopper fable to
which Strabo gives a naturalistic and Solinus a supernatural
tinge. In southern Italy, Rhegium and Locris are divided by a
river flowing through a deep ravine. The insects on the Locrian
side sing, while those on the other side are silent.</p>

<p>Strabo suggests that this is because it is sunny on the Locrian
side, and densely wooded across the river. In the one case the
membranes used in stridulation are dry and horny and therefore
resonant when rasped together; in the other, they are so
softened by shade and dew that they produce no sound. Solinus
has a simpler explanation. Hercules passed by Rhegium and
its grasshopper orchestra irritated him. So he bade the insects
be silent, and, resentful or forgetful, failed to lift the embargo.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Salamander</i></p>

<p>The best account of the salamander appears in the <i>Memoirs</i>
of Benvenuto Cellini. “One day,” he said, “when I was about
fifteen years of age, my father was in a cellar where they had
been scalding some clothes for washing. He was alone, and
was playing upon the viol and singing in front of a good fire
of oakwood, for the weather was very cold. On looking at the
fire accidentally, he saw a small animal resembling a lizard,
gambolling joyously in the midst of the fiercest flames. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
father instantly perceiving what it was, he called my sister and
me, pointed out the animal to us, and gave me a severe box on
the ear, which caused me to shed a perfect deluge of tears. He
gently wiped my eyes and said to me, ‘My dear boy, I did not
strike you as a punishment, but only that you should remember
that that lizard which you behold in the fire is a salamander, an
animal which has never been seen by any known person.’ He
afterwards kissed me and gave me a few quattrini.”</p>

<p>That the salamander is able to live in flames, Aristotle
thought, and Ælian, and Nicander, and Pliny. The last named
tells why: This lizard is so cold that it extinguishes fire like
ice. There is great danger in its venom. Unless precautions
are taken it might destroy whole nations, for if it crawls up a
tree it infects all the fruit and those who eat thereof are killed.
It will also poison water or wine in which it is drowned. Sir
Thomas Browne concedes that it may resist a flame or put out
a coal, but “thus much will many humid bodies perform.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Spider Dance</i></p>

<p>The tarantula is a large, brown mining spider which is found
on both shores of the Mediterranean, and is said to be numerous
near Taranto in southern Italy, whence its name. Its bite is
painful, although not dangerous, but in the fifteenth century
the superstition arose that it caused what is called tarantism,
a nervous affection with some of the symptoms of hydrophobia,
and now classed with St. Vitus dance. Those who were bitten, or
believed themselves to be, assumed a livid color, lost the senses
of sight and hearing, and sank into a deep depression; nausea
and sexual excitement were also remarked. Only music could
arouse the sufferer; under the influence of lively strains he
would dance himself into a perspiration and the poison of the
spider bite would escape through the skin. If the dance was
continued to exhaustion the patient was cured, at any rate for a
time.</p>

<p>The disease soon assumed the form of a contagion communicated
from one person to another. Dancers were violently
affected by bright colors. Red was the favorite, and then green
and yellow, and one man’s hue might be another’s madness.
Sufferers sought water, some plunging into the sea, others immersing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
their heads in a tub or carrying globes of water while
dancing. Old and young, skeptical visitors as well as natives,
and women more than men, were the victims. Attacks lasted
from two to six days, and recovery was effectual until warm
weather came the following year, when the symptoms had again
to be exorcised to music. One woman was a tarantant for
thirty summers.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the mania is in the writings of Nicolas
Perotti, a contemporary of Columbus. It broke out at the same
time that the St. Vitus dance appeared in Germany. A like
superstition and a like cure are known in a Persian province.
The northern nations were first to recover and since the seventeenth
century the epidemic has slowly waned. The lively
Neapolitan folk dance, called the tarantella, is a memorial of
the madness that set the Middle Ages dancing with a spider
calling the tune.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Swallow</i></p>

<p>Swallows show themselves suddenly in the northern climes
in April, and as suddenly vanish at the threshold of autumn.
They are often seen skimming the surface of water. Doctor
Kalm, the Swedish traveler, reports that in April, 1750, he saw
great numbers perched upon posts, “and they were as wet as if
they had just come out of the sea.” That the swallow comes
out of the sea in the spring and returns to it in the fall is a
belief of unknown antiquity. Thus, thought Luther, it repeated
each year the process of creation recorded in Genesis, when
the water obeyed the command to bring forth “fowl that may
fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.”</p>

<p>There is a considerable literature on the reputed hibernation
of the swallow. It has been credited with electing at will
the winter economy of the wild goose, the bear, or the batrachian.
In Mediterranean countries it is conceded that swallows migrate.
In England and Germany, according to one eighteenth-century
observer, they “retire into clefts and holes in rocks, and remain
there in torpid state.” In the colder northern countries popular
opinion has been that they submerge in the sea. Regnard, the
French comic poet, who made a journey to Lapland in 1681,
accepted this on the word of trustworthy Danes and Swedes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>In the eighteenth century the secretary to the city of Dantzig
obtained sworn testimony in support of this opinion from collectors
of the revenues of the king of Prussia. The mother of
the Countess Lehndorf reported that she saw “a bundle of
swallows” brought from under water to a warm room, where
they revived and fluttered about. Count Schlieben said that
while fishing on his estate he saw several swallows netted, one
of which he carried into a warm room; it lay there for an hour
and then began to stir and fly around. Collector-General
Witkowski said that in 1741 he got two swallows from the great
pond at Didlacken, and that these birds revived in a warm room,
“fluttered about, and died three hours later.” Six other witnesses
made their several oaths to similar incidents.</p>

<p>A final touch of poetry is given by the statement of Doctor
Wallerius, the celebrated Swedish chemist, who deposed “that
he had seen more than once swallows assembling on a reed till
they were all immersed and went to the bottom; this being preceded
by a dirge of a quarter of an hour’s length.” Holy,
luck-bringing, and inviolate, men everywhere have thought the
swallow, and the solemn descents into the sea with which legend
credited it deepened this character.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Wild Geese</i></p>

<p>About wild geese a still more fantastic belief obtained up
to four centuries ago, when the Dutch discovered Spitzbergen.
It was thought that goslings grew upon trees in the form of nuts.
The nuts fell into the sea and the chicks came forth. Therefore
a decree at the Sorbonne in Paris adjudged that wild geese were
not birds and could be eaten in Lent. In Spitzbergen, Barentz
came upon the breeding grounds of these migratory fowl, and,
breaking open the eggs, discovered the unhatched young in them.
So the myth passed. “It is not our fault,” he remarked, “that
we have not known this before, when these birds insist upon
breeding so far northward.” Two variants of the story are
found among Norwegian writers. Jonas Ramus says that “a
particular sort of Geese found in Nordland leave their seed on
old trees and stumps and blocks lying in the sea”; a shell forms
around the seed, and from the shell, as from an egg, young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
geese are hatched by the sun. Pontoppidan describes what
seems to be the goose barnacle which contains “the little creature
reported to be a young wild goose.” It looks like “little
crooked feathers squeezed together” and is merely a “living
sea insect.” While the legend was credited it was used to confirm
the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Animal Politics</i></p>

<p>Fable dowered various creatures with the political institutions
and social sense of the ant and bee. Pearl oysters were said
to live in settlements under the rule of the oldest. Cranes
placed sentinels on guard at night, each with a stone in its claw;
if the bird nodded the stone fell to the ground, betraying its
neglect of duty. Cranes, rooks and storks, even modern observers
assert, hold criminal courts. Twice a year a pair of
ravens was assigned to each farm in Iceland by a parliament
of their fellows. The storks of Egypt were supposed every
winter to make the Mecca pilgrimage and were regarded as
hajjis. Because the panther’s diet was aromatic roots and herbs,
its breath was balmy and medicinal, and when it walked abroad
all the other beasts attended it. Wild beasts and apes tended a
mountain shrine near Srinagar in India, bringing daily offerings
of flowers. In Ceylon “very pious and credible persons” told
Ibn Batuta that the bearded black monkeys had their own sultan,
who wore a green turban woven of leaves, as if he wished to
seem an Islamite, and maintained a council of state and a harem.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Other Animal Marvels</i></p>

<p>Marvel tales about animals might be recited almost indefinitely,
and a respectable authority ancient or modern, named for
each. A few representative ones may be noted. It is a well-known
fact, says Solinus, that magpies have died because they
could not master the pronunciation of a difficult word. In South
America, according to Purchas, men make clean their teeth with
the beards of seals, “because they bee wholesome for the toothache.”
The she-camel, so says Launcelot Addison, father of the
essayist, “brings forth her young in a negligent slumber.” The
toucan, says Humboldt, makes an extraordinary gesture when
preparing to drink, which the monks assert is the sign of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
cross upon the water, and so the creoles call it <i>diostede</i> (God
gives it to thee). Bordering the country of the grasshopper-eaters
in Africa, says Diodorus, is a fair land which has been
untenanted since rain bred a multitude of venomous spiders that
stung many persons to death and drove away the remainder.
Plutarch thought that the ibis became more sacred by standing
with straddled legs so as to form a triangle. Buffon confutes
the notion, based on the noisome odor of the shrewmouse, that
its bite is dangerous to cattle. Isaac Walton cites a polygamous
fish which “goes courting she-goats on the grassy shore.” Even
Linnæus thought that birds of paradise had neither wings nor
feet.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Pliny’s Mirabilia</i></p>

<p>Pliny is authority for the fables which follow: The ant rests
from her labors at the changes of the moon. The sea remains
calm while the halcyon is hatching her young upon it. When
the sun is in Cancer the bodies of dead crabs on the seashore
are transformed into serpents. When the porcupine stretches its
skin it discharges its quills like missiles. Lions resent it if a
man looks at them asquint. The breath of the elephant will
draw serpents from their retreats. Only by using the left hand
can one pull snakes from their holes. They will flee from a
naked man, but pursue one clothed. The best way to catch
eels is to put the bait in the end of a hollow fishing rod and
suffocate them by blowing through it.</p>

<p>Bears crawl into their dens on their backs in order to leave no
betraying trail. Ostriches throw stones at their pursuers. Vultures
will entice a bull over a precipice by holding their wings
before its eyes. The boding raven is most so when it swallows
its voice as if choked. If a horse follows in the track of a
wolf it will burst asunder beneath its rider. If a shrewmouse
crosses the rut of a wheel it will die at once. The pastern bones
of swine promote discord. Madness in he-goats may be calmed
by stroking their beards. She-goats in pasture never look at one
another at sunset. Goats breathe through their ears, are never
quite free from fever, and are therefore more lascivious than
sheep. Roebucks grow fat on poisons.</p>

<p>As to birds and insects, it is doubtful if they dream; yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
pigeons “have a certain appreciation of glory.” At a certain
season cuckoos become hawks. The crow is at enmity with the
weasel, the duck with the sea-mew, but there is friendship between
the peacock and the pigeon, the turtle-dove and the parrot,
the heron and the crow. Quails sometimes settle so thickly on
ships at night as to sink them. Locusts make their whirring
noise by grinding their teeth. Hornets, wasps, and bees will not
attack a person stung by a scorpion. In high winds bees carry
small stones for ballast. It is not certain whether their honey is
“the sweat of the heavens, or whether a saliva emanating from
the stars, or a juice exuding from the air while purifying itself.”</p>

<p>Stranger than these classic beliefs is the early Christian tradition
of the small hole found in the forefeet of pigs when the
hair is removed. Therein of old time passed the legion of
devils in the country of the Gadarenes. The rings about the
hole which seem branded in the skin are the marks of demons’
claws as they entered their unclean habitation. Javanese Moslems
have it that the peacock was gatekeeper of Paradise and admitted
the devil by swallowing him. A third domestic creature,
the cock, could scatter ghosts and demons by his dawn cry.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Browne Catalogues Vulgar Errors</i></p>

<p>The treatise upon <i>Vulgar Errors</i> which Sir Thomas Browne
made in the seventeenth century attacks many notions that had
come down to his time from a past without date. Among them
are the following: Swans sing their own death songs. The
badger has the legs of one side shorter than the other. Spermaceti
is the spawn of the whale. Lampries have nine eyes.
There is antipathy between the toad and the spider. There is
a lucky-stone in the toad’s head. The pelican pierces her breast
and feeds her young with her own blood. The clicking sound
made in a wainscoting by the beetle called the death-watch
presages bereavement. Peacocks are ashamed of their legs.
Storks will live only in republics or free states. Lions are
afraid of cocks.</p>

<p>Each of these beliefs the great physician confutes in turn,
remarking, for example, that storks nest in kingly France and
in the dominions of the Great Turk, and that a lion, escaped
from a menagerie, had robbed a hen roost in Bavaria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>Beasts of the Hermits</i></p>

<p>A chapter of charming legends has for its theme not the remarkable
traits of different species of animals, but the conduct
of single creatures that came under the influence of holy men
who went out into the deserts in the early days of the Christian
era. In the absence of human society the fowls of the air and
the beasts of the field formed for the hermit the society of the
waste. The crocodile, protected and worshiped by pagan Egypt,
the gross-looking hippopotamus, the venomous serpents, and
above all the hyena, with its fearful laughter, rimmed the
anchorite’s life with a horizon of supernatural terror; these
were embodied dæmons with designs upon his very soul. But
sometimes he could cast out the evil spirit that tenanted them,
and there were other and gentler beasts that became his servants
and companions. In them the unfriendly deserts were made to
repeat the polity of Eden, where all created things obeyed man.</p>

<p>Wild asses, lions, stags, wolves, and fowls were the hermit’s
domestic animals. Stags, harnessed to plow, cultivated the
field of St. Leonor, and took the place of St. Colodoc’s cattle
when these were driven away because he had sheltered a hunted
deer. St. Helenus rode on the back of a crocodile. Dragons
guarded the cell of Abbot Ammon. The lion from whose foot
St. Gerasimus extracted a thorn protected his ass. St. Costinian
saddled and rode a bear. St. Sulpicius tells of a she-wolf as
tame as a dog and of a lioness under a palm tree that moved
modestly aside at a hermit’s command until he had eaten his
fill of dates. Swallows sang upon the knees of St. Guthlac.</p>

<p>Not all of this, it may be, is the mere poetry of pious imaginations.
After the breakdown of Roman civilization in the west,
many of the oxen, horses, and dogs returned to the wild state,
and what the hermits did in some cases was merely to recall
them to their ancient allegiance. Here and there among so
many thousands of solitaries, so Kingsley urges, were men such
as become horse-tamers and bee-takers in settled communities,
whose natures won them friends in the world of brutes. The
very quietude of the hermits, their habit of silent meditation in
field and forest, would disarm the fears of wild things and draw
them toward companionship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Invasion of the Cathedrals</i></p>

<p>The church had yet another chapter to write in the story of
the beasts, and this time they became hieroglyphs on the vast
scroll of the cathedrals. The early significance of animals in
the life of man was completely revived in the mediæval fanes,
but as allegory rather than reality. Brute and fowl were created,
it was thought, only to illustrate the truth of God’s word
and to convey some spiritual message. Did not Job say, “Ask
the beast and it will teach thee, and the birds of heaven and they
will tell thee”? What they taught and told was set forth at
large in the cathedral, which became in very fact a rebus carved
in stone. With effects that were indescribably quaint, and beautiful
at times, Christian symbolism wrought itself in ecclesiastical
architecture in an age when few could read other writing.</p>

<p>From Egypt, where cenobites were already in communion
with desert creatures, the impulse came; and from India, where
Buddhist ascetics were taught to pattern their humility from the
ass that sleeps by the roadside, their aloofness from the rhinoceros
that wanders alone. Its immediate source was the
<i>Physiologus</i>, or Naturalist, the compilation by an Alexandrian
Greek of what the ancient world reported of animals and plants,
with moral reflections added. The compendium was translated
into all of the languages of Europe and several African and
Asiatic tongues, and, being in the vernacular, may have been
for a time more widely read than the Bible itself. For the
unlearned a source of pleasant stories and forerunner of the
bestiaries, for the learned it was a theological treatise. Its
subject-matter entered patristic writings and popular sermons
and was at length transferred to stone.</p>

<p>The vogue of animal symbolism in Christian churches covered
half a millennium, was at its height in the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, was still alive at the Reformation, and left
its marks in sacred vessels and ecclesiastical vestments as well
as in sculpture. Façades, portals, buttresses, and gargoyles of
church exteriors, and cloisters, chancels and chapels of interiors,
were decorated with animal forms. As an emblem
of priestly chastity, the elephant was embroidered on sacerdotal
vestments. Lamps, censers, and sacramental vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
repeated the outline or carried the effigy of the griffin, the pelican,
the dolphin. Sculptured lions ramped at cathedral doors,
lizards peeped from crevices, and all about the sanctuary were
the figures of foxes and ferrets, harts and hedgehogs, panthers
and partridges, the whale, the crocodile, the tortoise, and a hundred
other flying, walking, creeping, or swimming things.</p>

<p>Though St. Bernard denounced this as “the foul and tattered
vesture of pagan allegory,” every animal was a text, or was
designed to be. The lion typified majesty, the ox patience, the
ram spiritual leadership, the turtle-dove constancy, the skin-sloughing
snake the repentant believer, the salamander the
righteous who extinguish the flames of desire. The sun-staring,
youth-renewing eagle was an admonition to those grown old
in sin to face the day star of revelation. Ravens symbolized
Jews who battened on the carrion of the Law. Sometimes virtues
and vices were pictured as women riding animals or bearing
animal devices—Humility on a panther, Chastity on a unicorn,
Devotion on an ibex, Patience with a swan helmet, Love
with a pelican shield, Lust with a siren-buckler.</p>

<p>Animal symbolism had also its secular phases. Amorous
troubadours likened themselves to flame-walled salamanders;
or, disappointed in love, likened woman to the double-natured
dragon and the hooting owl. By degrees the secular impulse
invaded the churches. Animal sculptures were admitted as
such and not as cipher characters of divine script; and satire,
inspired or tolerated by the regular body of clergy, raided the
sheepfold of allegory. This was directed against the preaching
friars and the failings of the monastic orders, all the actors
in the beast-epos of Reynard the fox entering the sanctuary
as its auxiliaries. The animals overran windows, balustrades,
cornices, and capitals; foxes were significantly depicted in
palmer weeds; a stall in the cathedral at Amiens showed Reynard
preaching to a flock of fowls and with pious gesture reaching
for the nearest hen. Death, “the sarcastic and irreverent
skeleton,” capered among the creatures in the dance macabre.
At the outset an attack on religious abuses, the secular phase
became in effect a lampoon of the very rites of the church.</p>

<p>Among other figures that caricatured its principal ceremonies
under its own roof, says Evans in his authoritative study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the period, were “apes in choristers’ robes, swine in monks’
hoods, asses in cowls chanting and playing the organ, sirens in
the costume of nuns with their faces carefully veiled and the
rest of their persons exposed, stags in chasubles ministering at
the altar and wolves in the confessional giving absolution to
lambs.” The ass, which the east had long celebrated for its
devoted service and which has a high niche in biblical story,
attained a place in the churches of the west which neither fact
fully accounts for. There was thought to be some mystic relation
between its anatomy and the architecture of a cathedral.
In a catechism of the last century used in a French town it was
recited among other details that the head of the ass signified
the bell of the town cathedral, its paunch the poor-box and its
tail the aspergill for sprinkling holy water. In the one-time
popular Feast of the Ass, a living ass was led up the nave into
the chancel, the chants were sung in a braying tone, and the
officiating priest dismissed the congregation with a loud hee-haw.</p>

<p>The ceremony has passed. Most of the beast figures have
been removed from the cathedrals. Animal symbolism still
lives, but more in letters than in stone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5">Chapter V. The Fabulous Beasts</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the world that was, the fabulous animals that roved the
land were creatures of unusual interest, though of limited number.
More species were to be found in the deep. Thither,
Pliny explains, fall the seeds from the innumerable figures of
beasts impressed as constellations upon the heavens, and these
seeds, being mixed together in the watery element, produce a
variety of monstrous forms.</p>

<p>With animal life abounding in the thickets and fields of the
earth, and for every bird and beast a fable, there was less incentive
to invent new species of them than there was to make
stories of ghosts, dæmons and faeries, or of men with beast
attributes or lineage or some quality of caricature in their
anatomy. With the coming of heraldry the category of strange
creatures is greatly enlarged, but the shapes added by blazonry
do not purport to be living things and have no place in geography
or in literature, save in massive volumes where the quaint
designs and quainter jargon of a curious erudition are preserved.</p>

<p>The ancient had naïve ideas about cross-breeding. Every
unusual animal seemed a hybrid of two known species. These
were produced in hot climates. Hence, says Pliny, arose the
saying, common even in Greece, that “Africa is always producing
something new.” The males and females of various species
in that singular land, he thought, coupled promiscuously with
each other, but not always with impunity. “The lion recognizes,
by the peculiar odor of the pard, when the lioness has been
unfaithful to him, and avenges himself with the greatest fury.”</p>

<p>There was a belief, which lasted nearer to the present time,
that the savage dogs of India, two of which would make no
scruple of attacking the lion, had tigresses for their dams.
Diodorus noted that eastern Arabia produced beasts of double
nature and mixed shape, and he deemed it reasonable that “by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the vivifying heat of the sun in southern parts of the world
many sorts of wonderful creatures are there bred.” Among
these he cites the crocodiles and river horses of Egypt. He
strains a point in support of his theory in the account of what
he calls the Struthocameli of Arabia, “who have the shape both
of a camel and an ostrich.” He describes their bodies “big
as a camel, newly foaled,” their small heads with large black
eyes, their long necks, the “hairy feathers” on their wings, their
strong thighs, and “cloven hoofs.” This creature, says the
Sicilian geographer, “seems both terrestrial and volatile, a land
beast and a bird”—after all, only an inexact yet graphic portrait
of the ostrich. That this fowl is a cross between a camel
and a bird is an Arab notion; according to Aristotle it is of an
equivocal nature, part bird and part quadruped. So its Persian
name signifies, and sacred writers liken its voice to the bellowing
of a bull.</p>

<p>Even the breezes take part in the creation of hybrids, so men
have thought. That there is actual generative power in the wind
is a belief older than the discovery of its function in carrying
the fertilizing pollen of plants. Pliny records the popular belief
that barren eggs are breeze-begotten; hence their name of
Zephyria. The modern “wind-egg” for an egg without a shell
laid by a fat hen, but supposed by Doctor Johnson not to contain
the principle of life, comes from a similar notion. Male
sheep are conceived when the northeast wind blows, and females
when the south wind blows, according to the Romans. One of
the heroic ballads of the Tartars personifies the wind as a foal
which courses about the earth. The fable about Portuguese
mares, widely credited by the ancients and roundly asserted
by Pliny, is an echo of sailor reports on the fertility of Lusitania:
“In the vicinity of Olisipo and the river Tagus, the mares,
by turning their faces toward the west wind as it blows, become
impregnated by its breezes, and the foals thus conceived are
remarkable for their fleetness; but they never live beyond three
years.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Unicorn</i></p>

<p>Best known animal of legend is the unicorn. There are two
veritable unicorns, or animals with one horn—the rhinoceros<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and the narwhal. The accepted description of this animal gives
it the narwhal’s straight and spirally twisted horn but none of
the parts of the rhinoceros. It is pictured with the legs of a
buck, the tail of a lion, and the head and body of a horse. Its
markings suggest the zebra’s; its head is red, its body white,
its eyes blue, while its horn is red at the tip, white at the base
and black in between. The high authority of Aristotle has
determined these points.</p>

<p>The ancients mention five different animals as having one horn
set in the middle of the forehead. The most famous of these
were the Egyptian oryx and the Indian ass. Pliny says the oryx
gazes at the Dog Star when it rises, and sneezes in a sort of
worship. It has the stature of a bull, the form of a deer, and
hair that sets forward instead of backward. The Indian ass is
described by Ctesias as having the traditional shape and hues
of the unicorn, solid hoofs, and a horn a cubit in length. Filings
of this horn, if taken in a potion, are an antidote to poison.
Drinking cups made from it give immunity also from epilepsy.
The Indian ass is so fleet it can be seized only when it leads its
foal to pasture. In defense of its young it uses its horn, teeth,
and feet, killing horses and men. It is sought for the horn and
huckle bones, the latter, Ctesias declares, “the most beautiful
I have ever seen”; they are as heavy as lead, he says, and of the
color of cinnabar.</p>

<p>The third animal was the monoceros, on which the Orsæan
Indians preyed. It had the head of the stag, the feet of the
elephant, and the tail of the boar, while the rest of its body was
horse-like. The single black horn projecting from the middle
of its forehead was two cubits long. It lowed like a bull, was
of ferocious nature, wandered alone, and could not be taken
alive. The two other unicorns of ancient story were the single-horned
horse and the single-horned ox.</p>

<p>There was a second growth of the fable in the Middle Ages
and the unicorn took on new dignities. It was the only animal
that would attack the elephant, disembowelling the pachyderm
with one blow of its sharp-nailed foot; and it charged the lion
at sight. The king of beasts was constrained to kingly craft,
dodging behind a tree. His assailant, says Topsell, “in the
swiftness of his course runneth against the tree, wherein his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
sharp horn sticketh fast”; and the lion dispatches him at leisure.
In his <i>Display of Heraldry</i> (1724) Guillim says the unicorn is
never taken alive because “the greatness of his mind is such
rather to die.” Mediæval intelligence at last hit upon a characteristic
device to secure this creature without slaying him, and
the bestiaries of the time record it. This was to place a young
virgin near his haunts. As soon as he saw her he would run
to her and lie down at her feet, placing his head in her bosom,
when the hunters could halter him.</p>

<p>It was the alexipharmic virtues of the unicorn’s horn that most
engaged the ages of faith, when the poisoning of princes was
almost an article of statecraft. As late as 1789 it was used to
test food at the court of France, and horns, usually of the narwhal,
were in the royal museums. The ancients had made little
of this. The reference of Ctesias to the horn of the Indian ass
as an antidote for poison and a cure of the falling sickness
stands alone. What was later made of this reputed power is
shown in a passage from John of Herse, who pilgrimed to
Jerusalem in 1389: “Near the field Helyon in the Holy Land
is the river Mara, whose bitter waters Moses struck with his staff
and made sweet, so that the children of Israel could drink
thereof. Even now evil and unclean spirits poison it after the
going down of the sun, but in the morning after the powers of
darkness have disappeared, the unicorn comes from the sea and
dips its horn into the stream, and thereby expels and neutralizes
the poison, so that the other animals can drink of it during the
day.”</p>

<p>According to Guillim, it became “a general conceit that the
wild beasts of the wilderness used not to drink of the pools, for
fear of venomous serpents there breeding, until the unicorn
hath stirred them with his horn.” Thus its office was that of
water-conner for the other beasts of the forest.</p>

<p>Cosmas Indicopleustes said he had seen the brazen statues
of four unicorns set upon towers in the royal palace of
Ethiopia. Frobisher found a dead “sea unicorne” on the
Canadian coast with a broken horn two yards long. Into the
hollow of the horn the sailors put spiders, where they presently
died. In his second voyage (1564) Sir John Hawkins found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Florida Indians wearing pieces of the unicorn’s horn about their
necks.</p>

<p>The unicorn was celebrated in Christian symbolism before
it found a permanent niche in heraldry. When Balaam blesses
Israel he says, “God led him out of Egypt even as the glory of
the unicorn.” According to the <i>Bestiare Divine de Guillaume
Clerc de Normandie</i>, the animal represents Christ, and its horn
signifies the Gospel of Truth. It became a favorite charge in
Scottish heraldry and James I of England made it the sinister
support in the arms of Great Britain, replacing the red dragon
of Wales.</p>

<p>Purchas the Pilgrim was always expecting news of the unicorn,
hearing of it and doubting report. Browne avows his
belief in the animal in a sardonic dissertation. Far from doubting
its existence, he says, “we affirm there are many kinds
thereof,” and he mentions the five classic animals, several
fishes, and “four kinds of nasicornous beetles.” What he wants
to know is which one possesses the alexipharmic horn. He
complains that the animal is not uniformly described: “Pliny
affirmeth it is a fierce, terrible creature; Vartomannus, a tame
and mansuete animal; those which Garcias ab Horto described
about the Cape of Good Hope were beheld with heads like
horses; those which Vartomannus beheld he described with the
head of a deer: Pliny, Ælian, Solinus, and Paulus Venetus affirmeth
the feet of the unicorn are undivided and like the elephant’s;
but those two which Vartomannus beheld at Mecca
were footed like a goat. As Ælian describeth, it is in the bigness
of an horse; as Vartomannus, of a colt; that which Thevet
speaketh of was not so big as an heifer; but Paulus Venetus
affirmeth that they are but little less than elephants.”</p>

<p>Browne proceeds remorselessly: The horns of the unicorn,
as described by writers or preserved in collections, are too
various. Some are red, some are black, and some have spiral
markings, while “those two in the treasure of St. Mark are
plain and best accord with those of the Indian ass.” Albertus
Magnus describes one ten feet long, a narwhal’s, Browne suggests.
Others are but fossil teeth and bones and petrified tree
branches.</p>

<p>Yet the tradition long survived Browne. His contemporary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the Portuguese Jesuit Lobo, said that in Abyssinia he had seen
the unicorn, in shape like a beautiful bay horse with a black
tail. He could give no minute account, for it ran with prodigious
swiftness from wood to wood, and never fed save when
surrounded by animals that protected it. “The unicorn really
exists in Tibet,” Huc affirmed after traveling there in 1846.
At Kordofan, in 1848, a man, whose custom was to provide
Baron Von Mueller with animal specimens, offered to sell him
an <i>a’nasa</i>, which he described as of donkey size with a tail like
a boar’s, and a single pendulous horn which it erected when it
saw an enemy. In 1876 Prejevalski gave an account of the
<i>orongo</i>, a stag-like creature with two vertical horns, which he
said was common in Tibet; according to natives there were a
few single horned individuals among the herds.</p>

<p>Every feature in the unicorn legend of the west has its counterpart
in the Chinese books. Six species of unicorns are mentioned;
one figures in the crest of the Mikado of Japan; another
is sculptured in the avenue of animals that leads to the Ming
tombs north of Peking. Another, and the best known, the
<i>ki-lin</i>, appeared only in the reign of upright monarchs. It
was called a spiritual beast, chief of the 360 kinds of hairy
creatures. Its pace was regular, it ambled only on selected
grounds, and its voice was like a monastery bell. So softly it
trod that it left no footprints and crushed no living thing.</p>

<p>All a moon myth, says one ingenious writer. But Gould declares,
“I find it impossible to believe that a creature whose
existence has been affirmed by so many authors, at so many
different dates, and from so many countries, can be the symbol
of a myth.” He thinks it either a hybrid occasionally produced
by the crossing of the equine and bovine families, or else the
generic name for extinct missing links between horses, cattle,
and deer.</p>

<p>Whence the world’s long belief in the unicorn? Was there
such an animal, now extinct? Cuvier returns an emphatic negative:
“The nations of modern days have only been able to drive
back the noxious animals in the deserts, but have never yet
suceeded in exterminating a single species.” He goes further:
there could never have been a cloven-footed ruminant with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
single horn, because its frontal bone must have been divided,
and no horn could have been placed on the suture.</p>

<p>Ctesias may have woven some rhinoceros details into his
picture of the so-called Indian ass. The Egyptian unicorn was
called an oryx—a word perhaps related to the Sanscrit and
Teutonic aurochs. There is a large African antelope the modern
name of which is oryx. It is probable that the correct name
has been retained, and that the oryx, or gemsbok, of to-day, is
the unicorn of Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, Lampridius, et al. But
the real oryx has two horns, while the fabled animal had but
one because the Egyptians did not understand perspective in
drawing.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Griffin</i></p>

<p>Greek and Persepolitan griffins are curiously alike, and both
may have derived from the winged lion of the Assyrians, emblem
of the god Nergal. Griffin lore, however, is rich in details
which have no religious significance. Herodotus speaks of the
animal as guarding the gold of the one-eyed Arimaspians in
Asia north of the Altai Mountains. Ctesias places it in the mountain
barrier of India.</p>

<p>According to Ælian the griffin was a winged and feathered
lion with an eagle’s head and a color scheme that suggests the
German imperial flag—the breast plumage red, the wings white,
and the dorsal plumage black; “a mixed and dubious animal,”
Browne calls it. Ctesias says it had also blue neck feathers
and red eyes. He describes the species as a race of four-footed
birds the size of wolves, but Maundeville says they
were as large and strong as eight lions and could carry to
their nests “a great Horse, or two Oxen yoked together as they
go to the Plough.” Of their talons the Indians made drinking
cups. The griffins built their nests like the eagle, but laid
therein agates instead of eggs. The Bactrians said that these
birds dug gold out of the mountains and made their nests therewith,
and the Indians carried off so much of it as falls to the
ground. The Indians denied that the griffins were watchmen for
the gold of their district or had any use for it; they said that
when the birds see them coming to gather gold, they fear the intruders
are after their young and assail them. Also they attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
all other beasts and prevail over them, save only the lion
and the elephant.</p>

<p>Fearful of their vengeance, the natives go not out to gather
gold in the daytime, say the chroniclers, but under cover of
night make their raids into a frightful desert where griffin and
gold are found together. Companies of one thousand or even
two thousand men set out, equipped with mattocks and sacks.
The expeditions take from three to four years, for this region
lies afar. If successful, the members return wealthy; but should
they be detected in the act of theft, says Ælian, certain death
would be their fate.</p>

<p>There are four explanations of this four-footed bird of classic
legend and Welsh heraldry—that the winged Assyrian lion was
taken for a portrait instead of a symbol; that the Samoyeds mistook
mammoth bones in the gold-bearing district of the Ural
Mountains for remains of monster fowls; that the griffins were
merely Tibetan mastiffs of singular ferocity and reputed tigrine
decent, and that they are an early form of the dragon. The so-called
griffin’s claws in the museums of Dresden and Vienna
and in the churches elsewhere are horns of the Caffrarian buffalo.
Drinking cups made of them were used in treating
epilepsy.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Hippogrif</i></p>

<p>It would be vain to seek among animals the original of the
hippogrif, a creature related to the griffin, though of more involved
lineage, and like it treated sometimes as a bird, sometimes
as a beast. The hippogrif is a product of mediæval
romance, and wings its way as the courser of more than mortal
knights over countries of fable, albeit they bear such names as
Brittany, Abyssinia, Circassia, and Cathay. As the griffin was
called a hybrid between the lion and the eagle, so the hippogrif
was supposed to be a hybrid between the griffin and the
horse. It had the head, wings, and fore claws of the griffin and
the body, hind hoofs and tail of the horse. Its habitat was the
Riphæan Mountains, source of the north wind. The hippogrif
enters the Orlando cycle as the mount of an enchanter with a
castle on the Pyrenees, but later serves the far adventures of the
paladins of Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Monster Rat</i></p>

<p>The Samoyeds and Chinese who found in the river banks of
the north the frozen bodies of mammoths, with skin and flesh intact
as if they had died but yesterday, reached the strange yet
natural conclusion that this was a kind of monstrous burrowing
rat. It figures in Chinese books as <i>fen-shu</i>, the “digging rat,” or
<i>yen-men</i>, the “burrowing ox.” Why was it always dead when
men came upon it? Because air and sunshine were both fatal
to it; evidently in its wanderings underground it had broken the
crust above it and died in the daylight. Sometimes the Yakuts
saw the earth tremble and knew this great rat walked beneath.
“There is got from it,” says the <i>Chinese Encyclopedia</i>, “an ivory
as white as that of the elephant, but easier to work, and not
liable to split. Its flesh is very cold and excellent for refreshing
the blood.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Martikhora</i></p>

<p>In the jungles of Ind roved the martikhora—a creature with
unpleasant affinities to men, the great cats, and the serpents.
Its face was like a man’s with pale blue eyes and human ears
but with three rows of teeth. Its body was as big as the lion’s
and in color red like cinnabar. It had a tail like the scorpion’s
and more than a cubit long. The martikhora, indeed, was a
sort of anticipation of the machine gun, for it had one sting
at the end of its tail, two at the roots of this member, and a
fourth on the crown of its head; and these it projected to the
distance of a hundred feet. The missiles, which were about a
foot long and no thicker than fine thread, were fatal to every
animal save the elephants. The natives, says Ctesias, hunted it
from the backs of elephants. The name of the animal means
man-eater, so-called because the beast carried off men and
women. Its size, also, and general description, and the manner
of hunting it all suggest the tiger as fearful Indians might
report it. To this day the Cambodians think the whiskers of
the tiger are a strong poison. The Malays call it a demon in
beast form and speak of its Village where the houses are raftered
with men’s bones and thatched with human hair.</p>

<p>In heraldry the martikhora is called the montegre, manticora,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
or man-tyger, and is pictured with the body of a lion, the head
of an old man, the horns of an ox, and sometimes with dragon
feet.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Scythian Lamb</i></p>

<p>To match the barnacle goose which came from a nut, the ages
of faith had the Scythian lamb which grew in a gourd. Maundeville
has the best account, for did he not make a meal of one?
The creature is found in “a kingdom that men call Caldilhe,”
one of “the Countries and Isles that be beyond the Land of
Cathay.” In this country “there groweth a manner of Fruit, as
though it were Gourds. And when they be ripe, men cut them
in two, and Men find within a little Beast in Flesh and Bone
and Blood, as though it were a little Lamb without Wool. And
men eat both the Fruit and the Beast. And that is a great
Marvel.”</p>

<p>Friar Odoric makes a similar report. In other stories the
Scythian lamb is a true animal attached to the earth by its
umbilical cord. The Scythian lamb of botany is a woolly
fern (<i>Cibotium barometz</i>) with a prostrate stem turned upside
down. It is also called vegetable lamb and Tartarian lamb.
In his <i>Travels into Muscovy and Persia</i> (1636) the ambassador
from the Duke of Holstein describes it as a gourd like unto a
lamb in all its members and with the lamb’s sacrificial relation
to the wolf. It grows wild in the district of Samara, in Russia,
and its growing is a kind of destructive browsing. “It changes
places in growing, as far as the stalk will reach, and wherever it
turns the grass withers, which the Muscovites call feeding.”
When all available grass fails, it dies. The rind of the gourd
is covered with a sort of hair, which makes a good substitute
for fur. The natives showed the traveler certain skins, covered
with a soft frizzled wool “not unlike that of a lamb newly
weaned”—vegetable lamb, they affirmed. Scaliger declares that
alone among animals the wolf feeds on this gourd and that
wolf traps are baited with it.</p>

<p>So until 1915 stood the fable—seemingly just a tale of the
credulous Middle Age, rationalized by later science and gently
derided in still later rhyme. Then the scholarship of Berthold
Laufer, basing itself mainly upon Chinese texts, gave it long
backgrounds. The Scythian lamb has been in turn a mollusk, a
marine sheep, a bird, the cotton-plant, a strange half-human
creature and—this part is surmise—an allegory of the early
Christian Church, the Lamb of Revelation that “stood on the
mount Sion.”</p>

<p>Unto this day fabrics are made of the undyed fleece of the
true Scythian lamb. Byssus silk is the name it bears in commerce,
and Taranto is the seat of its manufacture. The silk
is derived from the fibrous foot by which mollusks of the
species called the pinna, found in the waters about southern
Italy, attach themselves to rocks. The original Scythian lamb
was this mollusk and its umbilical cord was the byssus, or foot,
which anchored it. The genesis of the legend seems to be a
statement of Aristotle that these creatures have within them
a parasite, a small crab, nicknamed the “pinna-guard” which
in gathering its own food collects fishes also for its blind, stationary,
and helpless host. Without the pinna-guard, says
Aristotle, the mollusk soon dies; and he cites the latter to illustrate
his observation that in the sea “there are certain objects
concerning which one would be at loss to determine whether
they be animal or vegetable.” After Aristotle’s time, and in
the first centuries of the Christian era, byssus fabrics, which
may have been a by-product of pearl fisheries in the Persian
Gulf, appeared in the Mediterranean countries.</p>

<p>Here, then, is an animal living within what passed for a
vegetable that was “rooted in earth,” and that produced a substance
later known as marine wool. But how did the Adriatic
mollusk and its tenant crab become a lamb-tenanted gourd, or
a veritable sheep attached to the soil by a fleshy stem, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
plains of Asiatic Scythia? And how did this tiny partnership
of the sea floor become in turn a phœnix-like creature of the
air and the grisly Yedua, man-monster of Talmudic legend?
The process illustrates the part that travel tale, the carrying
of confused reports from place to place, has in creating myth.
Though the fable grew up in the Roman Orient and reached
China only through such reports, the superior historical sense
of the Chinese has made their annals the key to its meaning.</p>

<p>The first Chinese record in point, not later than <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 220,
speaks of a fine cloth in the Roman Orient “said by some to
originate from the down of a water sheep.” This may be inference
from the almost contemporary phrase of Alciphron,
the Greek sophist, who calls byssus textiles “woolen stuffs out
of the sea.” In the sixth century Procopius recites that each of
the five hereditary satraps of Armenia had from the Roman
emperor a golden-hued cloak made from “wool gathered out of
the sea.” In an account by the Arab Istakhri, written about
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 950, it is said that an animal runs out of the sea and rubs
itself against the rocks, “whereupon it deposes a kind of wool
of silken texture and golden color.” Robes of this, worn by
the Ommiad princes at Cordova, were valued at a thousand
gold pieces each.</p>

<p>By etymological error and a device of ancient trade, the
mollusk, which had already become a water sheep, got itself
wings. Pinna, its name, is also the classic Latin word for
“feather,” an ambiguity which may have confused the Arabs;
and the filaments of the shellfish are rather like the plumage of
fowls. Byssus weaves were held at so high a price that they
were counterfeited in feather fabrics, and to promote their sale
the discovery of a wonderful bird was at length announced.
The Arab, Kazwini, calls it <i>abu baraquish</i> and pictures it as
like the stork; but “every hour its plumage glitters in another
color, red, yellow, green and blue.” The fabric from its plumage
is named “phœnix-feather gold” in a Chinese work of the
Mongol period. Skilled artisans, it is related, weave a soft
golden brocade from the neck feathers of the phœnix, which
in the spring drop to the foot of the mountains. These were
probably the feathered headskins of peacocks, which in China
are still made into jackets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>When the <i>Annals</i> of the T’ang Dynasty (618-906) were compiled,
the water sheep had become a land animal of Syria, or
Fu-lin as that country was called. Here is the Chinese account:
“There are lambs engendered in the soil. The inhabitants wait
till they are going to sprout, then build enclosures around as
a preventive measure for wild beasts that might rush in from
outside and devour them. The umbilical cord of the lambs is
attached to the soil, and when forcibly cut off they will die.
The people, donning cuirasses and mounted on horseback, beat
drums to frighten them. The lambs shriek from fear and thus
their umbilical cord is ruptured. Thereupon they set out in
search of water and pasture.”</p>

<p>It was part of the tradition of the marine sheep that it yielded
its fleece of its own accord, and this was carried over into the
later Chinese story that the Scythian or Syrian lamb must
itself rupture the umbilical cord, which others could not sever
without killing it. The appearance of men in armor to frighten
it to this end is elucidated by a passage from the thirteenth-century
Arab traveler, Abul Abbas. After the pinna comes
ashore and lets its wool escape, he records, it is pounced upon
by large crabs. In the Chinese story, these crabs have become
men on horseback and their shells are the cuirasses worn by the
horsemen.</p>

<p>A debased version of the same story appears in the Mongol
period when a thirteenth-century Chinese traveler describes the
“sheep planted on hillocks” in the countries of the western sea.
The umbilical cord of a sheep is planted and watered. At the
time of the first thunder peals it begins to grow. When matured,
the creature is frightened by the sound of wooden instruments
and, breaking off the cord that attaches it to the ground, roams
about in search of herbage. This was the tale Odoric and
Maundeville heard; that the lamb was inclosed in a gourd may
have been their own invention, or the report of some early attempt
to relate it to the cotton pod, which about a generation
ago was conjectured to be the basis of the fable.</p>

<p>“Creatures called Lords of the Field are regarded as beasts,”
says the Talmud. The same creature is also called the Man
of the Mountain. “It draws its food out of the soil by means
of the umbilical cord; if its navel be cut, it cannot live,” says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Simeon a thirteenth-century rabbi. In the detailed portrait by
Rabbi Meir the timid vegetable lamb undergoes a wolfish transformation:
“There is an animal styled Yedua, with the bones
of which witchcraft is practiced. It issues from the earth like
the stem of a plant, just as a gourd. In all respects the Yedua
has human form in face, body, hands, and feet. No creature
can approach within the tether of the stem, for it seizes and
kills all. As far as the stem stretches, it devours the herbage all
around. Whoever is intent on capturing this animal must not
approach it, but tear at the cord until it is ruptured, whereupon
the animal soon dies.”</p>

<p>Laufer thinks that the Jewish legend is early Christian allegory
misunderstood; that the Man of the Mountain is “the
lamb that stood on the mount Sion,” a symbol of the Church
itself the followers of which are attached to the earth by sensual
pleasures; and that the mounted horsemen of the Chinese version,
who cause the lambs to break their connection with the
earth, may be the two hundred thousand horsemen of Revelation
that symbolize the Last Judgment.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Gold-guarding Ants</i></p>

<p>Bits of turquoise, chips of obsidian arrow heads, and fragments
of prehistoric jewelry are found in the little heaps of
earth which ants bring up from underground on the sites of
vanished cities in New Mexico. On the Pajarito plateau ant-gold
is not unknown. Ant-gold is the theme of one of the
most circumstantial and puzzling stories told by ancient travelers.
Herodotus lays its scene somewhere near Cabul. The
Indians of that district send forth men in search of gold into a
sandy desert “where live great ants in size somewhat less than
dogs, but bigger than foxes.” A number of these were caught
by hunters and sent to the Persian king. The ants live underground
and, “like the Greek ants, which they very much resemble
in shape, throw up sand-heaps as they burrow.”</p>

<p>There is gold in the sand, but the ants are formidable enemies
and fleet in pursuit. So the Indians harness a female camel
between two males, and the female is one that has lately dropped
a foal. The inroad is timed so that the caravans arrive when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the sun is hottest and the ants are hiding from the heat.
Herodotus continues:</p>

<p>“The Indians fill their bags with the sand and ride away at
full speed; the ants, however, scenting them, as the Persians say,
rush forth in pursuit. Now these animals are so swift, they
declare, that there is nothing in the world like them; if it were
not, therefore, that the Indians get a start while the ants are
mustering, not a single gold-gatherer could escape. During
the flight the male camels grow tired and begin to drag;
but the females recollect the young which they have left behind,
and never flag. Thus, say the Persians, the Indians get most of
their gold.”</p>

<p>In substance the story is repeated in the letter which Prester
John sent to the Pope in the twelfth century. The “emmet
valley” also appears in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. Megasthenes said
that the plain tenanted by the monster ants is three thousand
stadiæ in circumference and lies eastward in the mountains in
the kingdom of the Dardæ. In winter the ants dig holes and
pile the auriferous earth in heaps at the pit mouths. Pliny
declares the ants are of the color of cats and the size of Egyptian
wolves; that they work in winter and are despoiled in summer.
“The horns of the Indian ant,” he remarks, “fixed up in the
temple of Hercules at Erythræ were objects of great wonderment.”
Nearchus, admiral of Alexander, reports having seen
skins of these ants as large as leopard skins. Ctesias speaks in
his <i>Persica</i> of a horse-pismire which was fed by the magi and
became of such monstrous size that it took two pounds of meat
a day to victual it. As late as the sixteenth century there is a
story by Busbequius that the Shah of Persia sent one of the
Indian ants as a present to Sultan Soliman at Constantinople.
Maundeville transfers the whole scene to Taprobane (Ceylon)
and varies the incidents: Men do not enter ant-land but send
thither mares to which empty vessels are suspended. “It is
Pismire nature that they let nothing be empty among them, but
anon they fill it, and so they fill those Vessels with Gold.” When
the foals neigh in the distance their dams return to them with
a golden burden.</p>

<p>What were these ants, and whence the fable?</p>

<p>It will be noted that the griffins were cast in a similar rôle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
in another Indian gold quest. It may be accepted that good-sized
animals, or the skins of animals, were seen in menageries,
museums, and temples, and identified with the ant custodians
of the Scythian metal. It has been suggested that these were
some other burrowing animal—the anteater, or the marmot;
but neither is fleet of foot. M. de Weltheim thought the Herodotoan
ant might be the corsac, a small Asiatic fox.</p>

<p>Philology has a word to offer. The gold collected on the
plains of Little Tibet is popularly known as <i>pippilika</i>, or “ant
gold,” from the belief that ants bring it up, or bare the veins
which carry it. McCrindle asserts that the gold-diggers were
neither ants nor other animals, but “Tibetan miners, who, like
their descendants of the present day, preferred working their
mines in winter when the frozen ground stands well and is not
likely to trouble them by falling in.” Thus the raid and retreat
would be accomplished with the same expedition with which
any tribe would make a sudden foray on another tribe equipped
with equal ordnance and cavalry. Metaphor still speaks of the
miner as a mole or a human ant.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Questing Beast</i></p>

<p>In <i>Le Morte d’Arthur</i>, Malory describes a singular animal
with an economy of phrase that whets curiosity. Arthur had
had a heavy dream of griffins and serpents that devoured his
land, and to put it out of his mind he went a-hunting. And he
followed a white hart until his horse fell dead under him and
his quarry was embushed. “He set him down by a fountain,
and there he fell in great thoughts. And as he sat him so, him
thought he heard a noise of hounds, to the sum of thirty. And
with that the king saw coming toward him the strangest beast
that ever he saw or heard of; so the beast went to the well and
drank, and the noise was in the beast’s belly like unto the
questyng of thirty couple hounds; but all the while the beast
drank there was no noise in the beast’s belly; and therewith the
beast departed with a great noise, whereof the king had great
marvel.”</p>

<p>Followed a knight hight Pellinore, and sought to borrow the
king’s horse to pursue this animal, and the king would have
taken over his quest for a twelvemonth, but he would not. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Pellinore’s death it is Palomides that rides across the pages
of romance, well in the rear of the questing beast.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Beasts of Revelation</i></p>

<p>The beasts of Revelation were but symbols; yet they moved
like realities through the imagery of the Church, and, undergoing
a sea change, appeared alive in the distant Atlantic Islands
of Irish epic. St. John beheld the shapes of locusts like unto
horses prepared for battle; “and their faces were as the faces
of men, and they had hair as the hair of women, and they had
tails like unto scorpions.” He saw also a beast coming up out
of the earth; “and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake
as a dragon.” Above all, John saw the beast that came up out
of the sea, a leopard with the feet of a bear and the mouth of
a lion, and with the dragon’s authority; and the beast had seven
heads and ten horns, “and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.”
The Whore of Babylon rode this beast—composite
of seven mountains and ten kings, the text explains—to world
power and to downfall; and rode on into literature, and an
unending controversy.</p>


<p class="large"><i>American Contributions</i></p>

<p>Animal elders are America’s main contribution to the collection
of fabulous beasts. The Indian believed that every
species had a giant ancestor like itself in form, but with supernatural
powers to protect it. Hunters who killed more animals
than they needed for food felt the vengeance of the elder beasts.
The latter gave a tribe its medicine, and themselves became
totems. They are sometimes represented as in human form
and living in stately lodges. The Pacific coast of South America
has also stories of a house-haunting ram, a repulsive tree-dweller,
a water-monster resembling a distended cowskin, and a
creature with the head of a heifer and the body of a sheep.</p>

<p>According to members of the Forest Service, American lumberjacks
have their own mythology. Product of camp-fire chaff
and a whimsical humor, the creatures that people it are noted
here only because, both in name and in nature, they illustrate
the traditional instinct for composites that elsewhere has
wrought to more serious ends. They include the tote-road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
shagamaw, with the head of a lion, the forepaws of a bear and
the hind legs of a moose; the splinter cat, which crushes hollow
trees in search of raccoons; the hugag, with buffalo body and
jointless legs, which sleeps leaning against a tree; the sausage-like
wapaloosie, which lives on fungi; the billdad, which kills
fish with its tail; the gumberoo, which explodes when it gets too
near a fire; the snoligoster, a spiked and legless crocodile, and
the lachrymose squonk. A common human figure in these tales
is the grotesque giant, Paul Bunyan.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Prodigies of Heraldry</i></p>

<p>In the later totemism, which is called heraldry, the following
fabulous creatures with human, animal, or bird attributes, or
an admixture of all of these, were represented on crests and
coats of arms: allerion, chimera, cockatrice, dragon, griffin,
harpy, hydra, lyon-dragon, lyon-poisson, mermaid, montygre,
martlet, opinicus, pegasus, sphinx, sagittary, satyr, tarask,
tityrus, unicorn, wyvern, winged lyon, winged bull.</p>

<p>Several of these are noted elsewhere in this study, and a word
will serve for the rest. The allerion is an eagle without beak
or claws. The chimera, says Bossewell, is “a beast or monstre
having thre heades, one like a Lyon, an other like a Goate, the
third like a Dragon.” The hydra is a seven- or nine-headed
water serpent. The lyon-dragon is a composite of a lion and a
dragon, and the lyon-poisson of a lion and a fish. The martlet
is a swallow without feet. The opinicus is a composite of
camel, dragon, and lion. The pegasus is a winged horse. The
sphinx is a figure with a woman’s head and breasts, a lion’s
body, and usually eagle’s wings. The sagittary is the centaur of
antiquity with the head, arms, and body of a man from the
waist up, united to the body and legs of a horse. The heraldic
satyr has a human face, a leonine body, and the horns and tail
of an antelope. The tarask is a dragon-basilisk on the shield of
Tarascon. “The tityrus is ingendred between a sheep and a
buck-goat,” says Guillim. The wyvern is a serpentine dragon
with a long tail and only two legs. The winged lyon is an
achievement of Venice, the winged bull a memory of Assyria.</p>

<p>Other heraldic creatures, not so well authenticated, are mentioned
by Randle Holme in his <i>Academy of Armory</i>. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
include the ass-bittern, the cat-fish, the devil-fish, the dragon-tyger,
the dragon-wolf, the falcon-fish with a hound’s ear, the
friar-fish, the lamya, compounded of a woman, a dragon, a lion,
a goat, a dog, and a horse; the lyon-wyvern, the minocane or
homocane, half child and half spaniel dog; the ram-eagle, the
winged satyr-fish, and the wonderful pig of the ocean.</p>

<p>The menagerie of blazonry has been enlarged by representing
nearly all of the animals at times with fish-tails, when they are
said to be marined. The zodiacal sign of the capricorn, shown
as half goat and half fish, is a familiar example. Sometimes
the sea-horse is drawn as an enlarged hippocampus, sometimes
with the forequarters of a horse and a fish tail. Griffins and
unicorns are marined in German heraldry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c6">Chapter VI. Fable upon Wings</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">For</span> the most part the winged creatures of fable are exiles
from mythologies broken down or forgotten. They are imperfect
and confused embodiments of the phenomena of the
heavens. In them one sees, what the men who repeated stories
about them did not see, the diurnal journeys of the sun into the
west, the shadowing storm-cloud, the lightning flash, the fury
of evil winds, the hail, and the snow. But the poetry of the
air, of which these creatures are the flying shreds, is weighted
with terrestrial prose. Extinct birds of colossal size, prehistoric
winged reptiles, and the bones of fossil mammals are reflected
in the shapes of cloudland. Few of the creatures that hover
there can be called fowls at all; their wings carry bodies that
belong upon the earth. Thus Pliny, in one of the most flagrant
of his carelessly credulous passages, makes the casual statement
that Ethiopia produces “horses with wings, and armed with
horns, which are called pegasi.” Because of its human affinities
the dragon must be considered by itself.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Phœnix</i></p>

<p>Of the phœnix, a true fowl of legend and its most renowned,
Maundeville has a vivacious picture. This bird, he says, “is
not much more big than an Eagle, but he hath a Crest of Feathers
upon his Head more great than the Peacock hath; and his Neck
is yellow after the Colour of an Oriel that is a fine shining Stone;
and his Beak is coloured blue as Azure; and his wings be of
purple Colour, and the Tail is yellow and red, cast in streaks
across his Tail. And he is a full fair Bird to look upon, against
the Sun, for he shineth full gloriously and nobly.”</p>

<p>Other men were not so sure about the phœnix. Herodotus
said he had never seen it and Pliny declared he was “not quite
certain that its existence is not all a fable.” Herodotus, however,
had seen its picture, and the Maundeville account is copied
from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The bird was Arabian, its legend Egyptian. It was said that
there was only one phœnix in the world, and that it appeared at
very long intervals. The Roman Senator, Manlius, wrote that
no person had seen it eat since its food was air, that in Arabia
it was sacred to the sun, and that its lifetime was five hundred
and forty years. When stricken with age it built a nest of cassia
and sprigs of frankincense and lay down to die; from its bones
and marrow issued a worm which in time changed into a small
bird. The first duty of the new bird was to perform the obsequies
of its predecessor, and carry the nest containing its myrrh-swathed
remains to the City of the Sun in Egypt, placing it
upon the altar of that divinity.</p>

<p>According to the more familiar account, when the phœnix is
full of years it flies to Heliopolis, sings its own dirge there,
flaps its wings to fan the funeral pyre, and presently is utterly
consumed; the next day emerges the new bird, fully feathered;
and on the third day, its wings well grown, it salutes the priest
and returns to the East. Still another account has it that in its
old age the bird casts itself on the ground, receiving a mortal
wound, and the new bird issues from the ichor.</p>

<p>In the censorship of the Emperor Claudius what purported
to be a phœnix was brought to Rome and exhibited in the
Comitium, but it was adjudged an imposture. Plutarch ventures
the daring statement that “the brain of the phœnix is a pleasant
bit, but that it causeth the headache.” He may have meant the
golden pheasant, or even wine from cocoanuts, but it is said that
Heliogabalus made a fruitless attempt to secure this unique
tidbit for his table.</p>

<p>Popular art reflects the phœnix legend, metaphor still more.
It is the favorite symbol of self-regeneration. The burned city,
the ruined country or cause, “rises like the phœnix from its
own ashes.” Jesus, whose death coincided with one of the
reported flights of the fowl to Egypt, was called the Phœnix by
monastic writers, and St. Clement of Alexandria cites the fowl as
proof that the dead will rise again. Its effigy was taken over
from the pagan urn by the Christian sarcophagus. Browne,
however, thought that the notion of a solitary phœnix was repugnant
to Scripture, “because it infringeth the benediction of
God concerning multiplication.” At one time its image hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
before chemists’ shops because of its association with alchemy.
Sometimes the Arabs confused it with the salamander and pictured
the latter as a bird.</p>

<p>The relation of the phœnix to astronomical reckoning gives
a clue to the legend. It reappeared, according to some authors,
at intervals of 250, 500, 654, 1,000, 1,461 or even of 7,006
years, but the accepted Phœnix Period or Cycle was 540 years,
and Egypt reports having seen the fowl five times, the first in
the reign of Sesostris, and the last time in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 334. This relates
the appearances of the phœnix to the Great Year, which Hardouin
says is 532 years.</p>

<p>It was an ancient belief that the same aspect of heaven and
order of the stars that had prevailed when the world began
recurred every 532 years, and that at one of these periods, with
all the planets in conjunction or all the stars returned to the
same point in the ecliptic, the world would be destroyed; or
else that it would perish and revive again to go through the
same sequence of celestial phenomena. The phœnix, self-regenerating,
sun-dedicated, westward-winging, arrayed in the gold
and purple of dawn and twilight, seems to be an obscure form
of the sun myth; and this inference is strengthened by the fact
that at Heliopolis a bird called the bennu was a symbol of the
Egyptians for the rising sun. It was a heron which “created
itself” and rose in a “fragrant flame” over a sacred tree. Bennu
in Egyptian and phœnix in Greek are the same word, and
signify the palm tree.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Fung-wang</i></p>

<p>There was a Chinese phœnix called the fung-wang which at
long intervals and only in the reigns of upright monarchs
emerged from the deserts. Six feet high, with plumage reflecting
the five colors that the Chinese recognized—red, white,
yellow, azure, and black—it was something like an immense
bird of paradise. It was called the chief of the three hundred
and sixty kinds of birds, and classed with the dragon and the
unicorn as a spiritual creature. On its poll appeared the
Chinese character for uprightness, on its back that for humanity,
while its wings enfolded the character for integrity. Its low
notes were bell tones, and its high like those of a drum. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
you play the flute, in nine cases out of ten the fung-wang comes
to hear, says the <i>Shu King</i>. It frequented only groves and
gardens and would not peck living grass. The <i>Bamboo Books</i>
record its visits as far back as 2647 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The emperor in
whose reign it first showed itself recast his cabinet so that officers
bore the names of birds, and the Minister of the Calendar
was called the Phœnix. “Another example of an interesting and
beautiful species of bird which has become extinct within
historic times,” rashly concludes Gould.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Flying Serpents of Araby</i></p>

<p>Another winged creature besides the phœnix sought to go out
of Arabia into Egypt, but its passage was opposed. This was
the flying serpent. Herodotus says he went to “a certain place
in Arabia” to ask about it. He saw the backbones and ribs of
these reptiles in inconceivable number, piled in a gorge, and
learned why they got no further. They are met in this place
by “the birds called ibises, who forbid their entrance and
destroy them all.” Hence the Egyptians hold the ibis in
reverence.</p>

<p>Josephus uses the incident as basis of a story about Moses
that is not in the Pentateuch. The Ethiopians had successfully
invaded the land of Egypt, and an oracle advised the defenders
to choose for their general Moses the Hebrew. His choice
pleased the scribes of both nations—the Egyptian because they
apprehended that Moses would be slain, and the Jewish because
they expected that he would be the instrument of their deliverance.
The line of march lay through the country of winged
serpents, powerful and mischievous creatures that came out of
the ground unseen or fell upon men from the air. But Moses
“made baskets like unto arks of sedges, and filled them with
ibes, and carried them along with him, which animals are the
greatest enemies to serpents imaginable, for these fly from them
when they come near them, and as they fly they are caught and
devoured.” So Moses passed on unscathed, and into the heart
of an Ethiopian princess through whose aid her father’s forces
were routed.</p>

<p>After centuries of discussion the sacred ibis of the Egyptians
was finally identified by the traveler Bruce with the bird the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Abyssinians call Father John; but the winged serpents have not
been satisfactorily explained. It has been suggested that what
Herodotus saw in the Arabian gorge was the remains of a locust
invasion—a difficult surmise, although Pliny reports that the
legs and wings of grasshoppers three feet long were dried in
the sun and used by the Indians for saws.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Roc</i></p>

<p>The case for the roc—a creature unknown to either Greek or
Roman legend—rests mainly upon three beguiling names of
travel tale. These are Aladdin and Sindbad of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, and Marco Polo of the <i>Diversities</i>. By the magic of
his lamp Aladdin, the wayward gamin of a Chinese city, had
won a princess and a palace; and he had poisoned the African
magician who sought to use him as a tool and then to take the
lamp from him. Bent on vengeance, the magician’s brother
stabbed a holy woman with the very un-Chinese name of Fatima,
disguised himself in her habiliments and won entrance
into the palace of Aladdin and into the confidence of his princess.
The latter asked the false Fatima what she thought of her
residence, and this was the reply.</p>

<p>“My opinion is that if a roc’s egg were hung up in the middle
of the dome, this hall would have no parallel in the four quarters
of the world, and your palace would be the wonder of the
universe.”</p>

<p>“My good mother,” said the princess, “what is a roc, and
where may one get an egg?”</p>

<p>“Princess,” replied the pretended Fatima, “it is a bird of
prodigious size, which inhabits the summit of Mount Caucasus;
the architect who built your palace can get you one.”</p>

<p>The princess consulted Aladdin, and, retiring to his apartment,
he rubbed the lamp; when a genie appeared, he bade
him procure the roc’s egg. Whereupon the hall shook as if
about to fall, and the genie exclaimed in a loud and terrible
voice, “Is it not enough that I and the other slaves of the lamp
have done everything for you, but you, by an unheard-of ingratitude,
must command me to bring my master and hang him
up in the midst of this dome? The attempt deserves that you,
the princess, and the palace should be immediately reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to ashes; but you are spared because this request does not come
from yourself.” Then he told of the presence of a conspirator
in the household. Aladdin’s killing of the latter is the final
episode of the tale, the fortunate adventurer and his spouse
soon mounting the throne of China.</p>

<p>Sindbad encountered the parent bird on his second voyage,
after he had been abandoned on an island; and first he saw
its egg. He mistook the egg for a white dome of prodigious
height and extent and found it fifty paces around and too smooth
to climb to the top. All of a sudden the sky became dark as by
a thick cloud and a huge bird came flying toward him. It
alighted on the egg, and Sindbad, creeping close to the shell,
tied himself by his turban to one of its legs, which was as big
as the trunk of a tree. The next morning he hoped the roc
would carry him away. Nor was his hope disappointed, and
after an immense journey in the air—quite from Madagascar to
India—the bird alighted in the Valley of Diamonds. There
Sindbad disengaged himself, only to fall into other adventures.</p>

<p>Marco Polo was the first veracious traveler to bring to the
west a report of the roc, and he was careful to state that he
did not see the bird; he only heard of it. The roc, he said,
comes to Madagascar from the south. It resembles the eagle,
but is so much larger that it can carry away an elephant. “Persons
who have seen the bird,” he continues, “assert that when
the wings are spread they measure sixteen paces [forty feet]
from point to point, and that the feathers are eight paces [twenty
feet] long and thick in proportion.” Messer Marco guessed
that these creatures might be griffins, half birds and half lions,
and particularly questioned those who claimed to have seen
them. No, was the reply, they were fowls altogether. Kublai
Khan sent messengers to Madagascar to confirm the story. They
brought back, as Marco heard, “a feather of the roc positively
affirmed to have measured ninety spans, and the quill part to
have been two palms in circumference.” The delighted khan
sent valuable gifts.</p>

<p>Two centuries afterward the roc reappears in the narrative
of Father Joano dos Santos, a Portuguese Dominican friar
traveling in eastern Ethiopia. He tells of a fellow Portuguese
faring inland in Madagascar to purchase ivory, and leading a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
large monkey on a chain. This he fastened to the trunk of a
tree and lay down to rest; a monstrous bird snatched up both the
monkey and the tree and flew away. The Shoshones have a
story of an owl which carries men away to its island larder.
Mewan legend speaks of the cannibal bird Yel-lo-kin with wings
like pine trees which snatched children by the top of the head
and bore them through the hole in the middle of the sky to its
nest on the other side.</p>

<p>While the roc belongs to nature myth, matter-of-fact has a
word to say. The extinct dodo is recalled, which, however,
could not fly. The feather brought to Kublai, and the monstrous
stump of a roc’s quill which it is said was brought to Spain by
a merchant from the China seas, may have been taken from a
species of palm growing in Madagascar which has quill-like
fronds. Southern Madagascar is frequented by very large
birds—the albatross with a wing-spread of fifteen feet, and the
condor, which may measure more than ten from tip to tip.</p>

<p>Everybody in the east believed that the roc, or more correctly
the rukh, really existed. When the utmost depths of Arabic
credulity are sounded, one reaches the probable basis of a
legend into the superstructure of which exaggerated details of
natural history have been built. One Arab writer says the
length of the roc’s wings is ten thousand fathoms, or nearly
twelve miles, and these dimensions would make a fair-sized
storm cloud. A Chinese tale describes the bird as a fowl which
in its flight obscures the sun, and of whose quills “water-tuns”
are made. One of the riders of the roc in another tale from the
<i>Thousand and One Nights</i> is admonished to stop his ears from
the wind, “lest thou be dazed by the noise of the revolving
sphere and the roaring of the seas.” It is shrewdly surmised
that the roc is the storm cloud and the egg it covers is the sun—true
master of the slaves of Aladdin’s lamp.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Rhinoceros of the Air</i></p>

<p>Another monstrous fowl, the rhinoceros of the air, was
reported in mediæval travel and still commands the faith of the
Samoyeds. Purchas abstracts the description given by Andrea
Corsali in his Abyssinian travels. The bird is much bigger than
an eagle and has a bow-fashioned bill or beak four feet long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
with a horn between the eyes streaked with black. “It is a cruel
fowle and attends on battels and campes.” The Siberian myth
gives this winged rhinoceros gigantic dimensions. The tusks
and bones of the great pachyderms, found in the tundras, are
thought by native hunters to be the beaks and talons of monster
birds. The nearest approach of fact to the Abyssinian prodigy
is perhaps the horned screamer, or unicorn bird, whose cries
“resembling the bray of a jackass, but shriller,” unpleasantly
disturbed for the naturalist Bates the solitude of the Brazilian
forest.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Harpies</i></p>

<p>Those forbidding sister groups, the gorgons, the sirens, and
the harpies, are perhaps different aspects of the storm clouds
and the storm wind—the baleful lightning, the shrieking sea
gales, the violent gusts that snatch (<i>harpazo</i>) away soul and
body. Of the three, the gorgons and sirens will be left within
the domain of nature myths. The harpies may be migrants
from the religions of Egypt, in which Nekhbet, the vulture-goddess,
is sometimes represented as a woman with a vulture’s head,
and the soul is depicted as a human-headed bird fluttering from
the mouths of the dying. Yet they have that savor of the soil,
that touch of the grotesque, that suggestion of coarse reality that
belong rather to travel tale. Though with woman faces, their
attributes are animal.</p>

<p>Hesiod describes them as maidens, winged and golden-haired,
who harassed the blind King Phineus at his banquets. The myth
is retold in grosser form in the story of the Argonauts, whence
these sisters, driven away by the comrades of Jason, make their
flight to the Æneid and find roost in an isle where the Trojans
cast anchor. The picture Virgil drew of them superseded the
more flattering accounts of poets before him, and the immense
vogue of this poet in later ages led the romancers of the Charlemagne
cycle to adopt his report without abatement.</p>

<p>The harpies of Virgil are, as the poet Morris pictures them,
“dreadful snatchers,” like women down to the breast, with
scanty, coarse black hair, dim eyes ringed with red, bestial
mouths, gnarled necks, and birds’ claws. Their faces are pale
with hunger. When the Trojans slay the island cattle and prepare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
meat for a feast, the birds swoop down with a horrible
clamor, seize part of the meat, and defile the rest. Nimbly they
dodge the Trojan swords, and their feathers are like steel mail.
From a cliff they reproach the visitors for slaying their cattle
and warring upon them, and as Æneas departs they shriek direful
predictions after him.</p>

<p>In the legends of Charlemagne the bird-sisters reappear when
Astolpho, cousin of Orlando, reaches Abyssinia riding the hippogrif.
Here is another blind king, like Phineus, “prey to a
flock of obscene birds called harpies, which attacked him whenever
he sat at meat, and with their claws snatched, tore, and scattered
everything, overturning the vessels, devouring the food,
and infecting what they left with their filthy touch.” They are
put to flight with one blast of Astolpho’s horn and driven by him
and his hippogrif into a cavern, the entrance of which he blocked
up so that they are seen no more.</p>

<p>That is, so far as the romancer of that time knew. They
reappeared in the New World on the Isthmus of Darien, where
Balboa was pursuing, amid the fens of a haunted land, the adventure
of the mines of Dobayba and the elusive golden temple.
The Indians told him there had been a horrible tempest, and
when they ventured forth again they found that two monstrous
creatures had come in with the storm. They were apparently a
mother and her daughter. They had woman faces and eagle
claws and wings; the branches of the trees where they perched
broke with their weight. Swooping down, they would seize a
man and carry him away to the hilltops to devour him. At last
the natives killed the older bird by a stratagem, and, suspending
her body from their spears, bore it from town to town to appease
the alarm of their people. The younger harpy disappeared.</p>

<p>Natural history has given the name of harpy to a buzzard, an
eagle, a fly, and two species of bats. Neither of the last named,
however, is the vampire bat of which Bates has left a portentous
portrait. Its spread of wing is nearly two and a half feet.
“Nothing in animal physiognomy can be more hideous than the
countenance of this creature when viewed from the front; the
large, leathery ears standing out from the sides and top of the
head, the erect, spear-shaped appendage on the top of the nose,
the grin and the glistening black eye, all combining to make up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
a figure that reminds one of some mocking imp of fable.” It
seems to be fact that villages in Central America have been
abandoned because of the nocturnal attacks of this animal.
Dampier professes to have seen on an island near Sebo bats
“with bodies as big as ducks and with a wing spread of eight
feet.” The custom of nailing up dead bats as witch-or-devil
forms is common. “An animal,” says Buffon, “which, like the
bat, is half quadruped and half bird, and which, in fact, is
neither the one nor the other, is a kind of monster.” He suggests
that “the wings, the teeth, the claws, the voracity; the nastiness,
and all the destructive qualities and noxious faculties of
the harpies bear no small resemblance to those of the Ternat
bat.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Stymphalian Birds</i></p>

<p>The Stymphalian birds, according to Greek legend, frequented
a lake in the northeast of Arcadia, which lay on the
main route from Argolis and Corinth westward. To disperse
or destroy them was the sixth labor of Hercules. These birds
were anthropophagous, used their feathers as arrows, and were
equipped with brazen claws, wings, and feet. Diodorus has a
milder account in which they figure merely as voracious poachers
of the fruits of the neighborhood. With a brazen pan the
hero made such an uproar that they flew away, appearing again,
in the story of the Argonauts, as tenants of the island of Aretias.</p>

<p>Pausanias visited the township of Stymphalus in his tour of
Greece. He describes a temple to Artemis Stymphalia standing
there, and the figures of the birds Stymphalides under its roof;
behind the temple were marble statues of young women with the
legs of fowls. The birds, he says, are as large as cranes, but
resemble the ibis save that they have stronger beaks and less
curved; so, indeed, they are represented on coins of Stymphalus.
Herodotus rationalizes the legend by intimating that their feathery
arrows were, in truth, hail or snow.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Cockatrice</i></p>

<p>“The weaned child,” said Isaiah, prophesying the good time
coming, “shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den.” The cockatrice
was a monster with the head and plumage of a cock and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
a barbed serpent’s tail, and so it is represented in heraldry. The
word is an old French corruption of the Latin for crocodile, but
popular etymology attributed the name to the fact that the prodigy
was hatched from an aged cock’s egg by a serpent. Because
of the crest crowning its head it is also called a basilisk, from
the Greek <i>basilikos</i>, or “little king.”</p>

<p>Its habitat was Africa. It was horrid to look upon and its
glance and breath were alike fatal, while its voice struck terror
to other serpents. Its own image, reflected in a mirror, would
kill it. The basilisk of Cyrene, Pliny said, was not more than
twelve fingers in length, but it destroyed all shrubs save the rue,
and consumed grasses and shattered stones merely by breathing
upon them. “He infecteth the water that he cometh neare,”
according to Leigh. It was believed that if a horseman killed
a basilisk with a spear-thrust, its poison would ascend the
weapon and destroy not only the rider, but his mount. Even
its dead body hung in a temple kept swallows from building and
spiders from spinning there. However, if a man saw the basilisk
first, he went scatheless and the creature itself might die,
while women could seize it without suffering harm. The effluvium
of the weasel and the crow of the cock were alike fatal to
it. Travelers passing near its haunts sometimes took a cock
along.</p>

<p>While its deadly nature has persisted, the shape of the cockatrice
has changed. To the ancients it was merely a baleful
lizard. Its confusion in the Middle Ages with the cock gave it
feathers and a beak. As soon as hatched by a toad or snake
from a cock’s egg laid in a stable it hid itself in crevice, cistern,
or rafter, for to be seen was to die. Later the heralds and painters
represented it with the head of a hawk, sometimes even with
the head of a man. Its ashes would turn base metals into gold.
People thought that cock’s eggs were used in the devil’s chrism
whereby his anointed hags could assume beast form or ride the
clouds. In Browne’s time there was traffic in counterfeited cockatrices
made by joining the dead bodies of pheasants and serpents,
or out of the skins of thornbacks. The basilisk of natural
history, which may have been the original of the fable, is a
harmless creature, although of frightful aspect.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">Chapter VII. The Dragon</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> dragon of pagan and early Christian legend was a
winged crocodile with a serpent’s tail. As the word is used by
travelers, often a crocodile or a snake rather than a fabulous
composite animal is intended. There are three animals listed
in natural history which somewhat resemble this creature. The
dragon-fly is a frightful-looking but entirely harmless insect;
how the supersession of myth by science has shifted values is
illustrated by the fact that the ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> gives nearly four pages to the insect and only a
dozen lines to the fabulous monster, the destruction of which in
another age was the crowning exploit of gods and men. There
is also a small flying lizard, native to the East Indies, which is
called a dragon and which in miniature is a fair copy of fable.
The primeval world knew a veritable dragon in the pterodactyl,
a flying lizard with a wing span of seventeen feet.</p>

<p>In the Far East the dragon was a four-legged serpent with
rugged head and spiked ears, and, though without wings, it flew.
There was more of the crocodile in the dragon of the Near East.
It had four short paws, a forked tongue, and bat wings, and fire
came from its mouth. The dragon of heraldry had a squat,
scaly body, a head with horny projections, long clawed legs, a
barbed tongue, and bat wings.</p>

<p>There were four noteworthy things about the dragon. It was
watchful, it spat fire and smoke, it ejected poison, and it had
control of water. The dragon watched the golden apples in the
garden of Hesperides where Hercules found and slew it. It
guarded the Valkyrie Brynhild in a castle on the Glistening
Heath. Although ecclesiastics of the Middle Ages used the
word to symbolize sin and particularly pagan worship, yet until
very recent times the world accepted the dragon. The elder
naturalists, such as Gesner and Aldrovandi, picture it in their
works. A mediæval writer says that at the midsummer celebration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
lads burned bones and filth to generate a noxious smoke,
and so to drive away dragons, which, excited by the summer
heat, copulated in midair, poisoning the wells and springs by
dropping their seed in them.</p>

<p>For what it is worth there is documentary evidence of dragons
in the Alps, all of it attested by oath. The depositions were
gathered early in the eighteenth century by Prof. Johann Jacob
Scheuchzer and are thus summarized in Francis Gribble’s <i>Early
Mountaineers</i>: “There are dragons with and without wings,
with and without legs, with and without crests; dragons with cat
faces, with human faces, and with nondescript faces; dragons
that breathe fire and dragons that do not breathe fire.”</p>

<p>Scheuchzer was impelled to this inquiry when he found there
were graven images of dragons on Swiss public buildings and a
“dragon-stone” in a Lucerne museum. The latter item he says
is a jewel cut out of a dragon’s head in its sleep. If the monster
awakes before the operation is complete, it will die and the
stone will vanish. To forestall awakening, drowsy herbs are
scattered about, and sometimes incantations are muttered. The
dragon-stone is a remedy against plague, poison, dysentery, and
nosebleed. Scheuchzer concludes that the Lucerne dragon-stone
is no imposture because it does effect cures, because the Alps
afford many caves for dragon haunts and because of the testimony
of eye-witnesses as above.</p>

<p>In June, 1673, Joliet and Marquette saw two dragon forms
carved and painted along a bluff that overlooks the Mississippi
at Alton, Illinois. Says Père Marquette: “As we
coasted along rocks, frightful for their height and length, we
saw two monsters painted on one of these rocks, which startled
us at first, and on which the boldest Indian dare not gaze long.
They are as large as a calf, with horns on the head like a deer,
a fearful look, red eyes, bearded like a tiger, the face somewhat
like a man’s, the body covered with scales, and the tail so
long that it twice makes a turn of the body, passing over the
head and down between the legs, and ending at last in a fish’s
tail. Green, red, and a kind of black are the colors employed.”</p>

<p>These outlines, which have been called the highest attainment
of early Indian pictorial art, and which Marquette said the best
painters of France could scarcely equal, became known as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Piasa petroglyph. Quarrymen destroyed them shortly before
the Civil War, but drawings were made of them by artists who
followed descriptions. One surmise is that they represented the
Algonquin thunder bird.</p>

<p>A copious and curious literature treats of the dragon as a
veritable creature of natural history. According to Ælian,
although the Ethiopians call it the slayer of elephants, it conceals
itself when it hears the noise of the eagle’s wings. When
it lies in wait for man or beast, it consumes deadly roots and
herbs. At Lanuvium naked virgins paid it the annual tribute
of a barley cake to insure a fruitful year. Passing the cave of
a sacred Indian dragon, the army of Alexander was affrighted
by hissing and blowing and the apparition of a head with eyes
“of the size of a Macedonian shield.” Artemidorus adds the
detail that the Indian and African dragons have grass growing
on their backs. “You burst asunder vast bulls” is Lucan’s apostrophe.
Ignatius reports that the library of Constantinople had
the intestine of a dragon 120 feet long on which the Iliad and
Odyssey were inscribed.</p>

<p>Chinese reports are very detailed. In the great Materia
Medica of the early seventeenth century it is said that the dragon
has nine resemblances—its head like a camel’s, its horns like a
deer’s, its eyes like a hare’s, its ears like a bull’s, its neck like
a snake’s, its belly like an iguanodon’s, its scales like a carp’s,
its claws like an eagle’s and its paws like a tiger’s. It is whiskered
and its voice resembles the beating of a gong. The
dragon, however, cannot hear itself, for it is deaf. It is fond
of gems and jade and excessively fond of swallow’s flesh; but
it dreads iron, beeswax, the mong plant, the centipede, the leaves
of the Pride of India, and silk dyed in the five colors. It passes
the winter in muddy water contemned by the fish and turtle, and
in summer the moles, crickets, and ants annoy it. At five hundred
years it grows horns. “If you do not ride on a dragon,”
says one writer, “you cannot reach the weak waters of Kwan-lun
hill.” Another suggests that if you eat dragon’s flesh soaked
in acid “you can write essays.”</p>

<p>It was a belief among Chinese that dragons did not die, but
merely sloughed off their bones as a snake its skin. These were
used to cure a variety of diseases and are still sold in apothecaries’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
shops. The records speak of a bone-covered dragon
plain east of the hills of Fang-chang, and of isles where the
dragons shed their bodies; “teeth, horns, spines, feet, it seems
as though they are everywhere.” The identification is perhaps
with those deposits of dinosaur and other paleontological
remains which modern exploration has uncovered.</p>

<p>The naturalistic side of Chinese dragon lore is not far
removed from the position taken by Charles Gould, the stoutest
defender of the literal basis of wonder stories (<i>Mythical Monsters</i>,
1886). He finds nothing impossible in the dragon of tradition
and thinks it more likely that it once lived than that fancy
engendered it: “It was a long, terrestrial lizard, hibernating and
carnivorous, which dragged its ponderous coils and perhaps
flew; which devastated herds and on occasions swallowed their
shepherd; which, establishing its lair in some cavern overlooking
the fertile plain, spread terror and destruction around, and,
protected from assault by dread or superstitious feeling, may
even have been subsidized by the terror-stricken peasantry, who,
failing the power to destroy it, may have preferred tethered
offerings of cattle adjacent to its cavern, to having it come down
to seek supplies.”</p>

<p>But the dragon reached a place in the political and spiritual
life of China such as a mere saurian hardly could attain. The
empire was called “the dragon empire”; the imperial throne,
“the dragon throne”; the emperor’s countenance, “the dragon’s
face”; his beard, “the dragon’s beard.” In pictured effigy, the
dragon rears itself upon house fronts and draws its scaly folds
over garments and utensils as well as across the imperial
flag; and there are annual processions of dragon images, regattas
of dragon boats, and sacrificial ceremonies in dragon temples.
To a third of mankind, for five thousand years or more, the
dragon has been the bestower of rain and the great giver of
good, and the emperor its earthly representative.</p>

<p>As in other matters, China has merely preserved and exaggerated
beliefs which were world-wide. Nearly all of the
thrones of earth were once dragon thrones. On the shield of
Agamemnon, king of kings, was “the unspeakable horror of a
dragon glancing backward.” Persians, Parthians and Scythians
had dragon flags and Rome borrowed them for its cohorts. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
dragon flew on the battle standards of German, Celt, and Saxon,
and breasted the foam of the seas as the figurehead of Norse
longboats. In the older Europe, as in the China of to-day, it
was carved on house gables, bells, musical instruments, goblets,
weapons, chairs, and tables.</p>

<p>Under these world-wide customs, was there only a giant reptile
not long extinct, an inference from fossil remains, some
frightful-seeming but diminutive lizard contemporary with man
and magnified a thousand times by the aberrations of fancy?
All of these things there may have been, for the myth is so complex
that its development has been called the history of civilization.
But inevitably speculation had to rise higher than a
saurian to account for phenomena of such consequence; it was
conceived that the dragon was the storm-cloud and he who slew
it the sun. So, it may be, ingenious minds surmised thousands
of years before modern conjecture first spoke of solar myths
and found in forgotten texts not the heart of the thing, but allegories
in which ancient solar mythologists had wrapped it. Or,
it was guessed, the dragon typified the spirit of evil, a power to
be placated by sacrifice and politic devil-worship, but destroyed
as opportunity offered. So the world long thought, and so far
as it thinks at all of the dragon, that is what it thinks now.</p>

<p>To assume that the myth is an allegory of satanic forces is to
explain much, but does it explain all? Powerful as is the motive
of fear, it is negative. Was it potent enough to coil a
dragon at the roots of all the world’s religions; and when these
arose, were men able to speculate on so abstract a thing as evil
and symbolize it as a composite beast? The Bible narrative
begins with the dragon of Genesis in the Garden of Eden and
ends with the dragon of Revelation, “that old serpent which is
the Devil and Satan,” in the bottomless pit. The slaying of the
dragon is the central point of Norse and Saxon epic, the great
deed of the heroes. The water monster of Navaho legend is a
dragon; the elephant-headed thunder god of the Mayan inscriptions
is a dragon deity; the legendary founders of both Athens
and Mexico were dragon-tailed. Snake worship is dragon worship
and, like the Midgard serpent, it encircles the earth. Everywhere
the myth is a thing of thrones and temples.</p>

<p>Perhaps its secret is to be found, as later in this study it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
be seen that the secret of the Amazon myth is to be found, in
the time when thrones and temples were one. Clues that lead
to it are: (1) the world has still a dragon throne, or rather a
recent memory of one; (2) always in the lore of dragon or
serpent, whether as victim, votary, or mate, appears the figure
of a daughter of Eve; (3) the snake is the badge of Æsculapius
and the symbol of healing; (4) the dragon, whether haunting
cloud or pool, is associated with water.</p>

<p>Woman is the physical source of human life. Water is healing,
fertilizing, and regenerating. Use the Scriptural figure,
“the water of life,” and it relates itself to woman and to the
serpent symbol of the art that lengthens life. When the throne
and temple were one, the creation and continuation of life was
the function of the priest-king, though only in China has his
tradition come down to the modern time. The Chinese emperor
was himself the dragon. In the spring festivals of his people
he supplicated heaven for rains that would revive the land, and
in the autumn festivals he rendered thanks for nature’s bounty
or took upon himself the blame for dearth.</p>

<p>The dragon myth is not a myth of fear, nor was the dragon
in the beginning a personification of evil. It was an expression
of the deepest desire of man, the desire to defeat chance
and change, to repeal “the sad laws of time” and to live forever.
Of all myths, that of the dragon is the fundamental, for
the forces with which it deals are the forces which have impelled
man, in a long grapple with destiny, to construct societies, build
religions, and create an art and a literature. In China both the
significance and the origin of the legend lie almost on the surface.
In most other places and at most other times its meaning
has been distorted, inverted, weighted down with fancies and
guesses. As it stands, it is like the fabric of a vision in which
tatters of experience are woven on the looms of sleep by the
master weavers of hope and fear; and in this faded grotesque
one may decipher the eternal dream of mankind.</p>

<p>The theory which will be interpreted here is that of Grafton
Elliot Smith (<i>The Evolution of the Dragon</i>: 1919). It is too
sweeping in its implications and too revolutionary yet to have
received the general sanction of writers upon mythology; but
among all dragon theories it must take precedence because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
alone it has the elemental breadth demanded by the phenomena
to be accounted for. A difficult thing about it is that the author
rejects the doctrine accepted of the time, that the same beliefs
and practices can arise independently in two or more places.
Unless there is in any case definite evidence to the contrary, he
assumes that “no ethnologically significant innovation in customs
or beliefs has ever been made twice.” It is his contention
that the dragon myth was born in Egypt, developed in Babylonia,
and in a time remote carried to China, India, and the
Americas, and to all other parts of the earth. Granting this,
it becomes not merely the one world-epic, but the proof that,
before history began even as now, all races of men were in
effectual contact.</p>

<p>The primitive custom at the basis of the myth is well established.
The post of priest-king was enviable but dangerous.
With each recurring spring he was expected to bring fertility
to his land; but sometimes he was killed and a successor
appointed each year, in imitation of the death of vegetation that
preceded the resurrection of spring; and always when age overtook
him he was slain, for what vital magic over nature was
there left in his aging frame? To avoid this fate a mock king
was erected to suffer in his stead; or a virgin was sacrificed;
or in elaborate mummery a ritual murder was merely simulated.</p>

<p>Here in their simplest form appear all the elements of the
dragon myth—a king who was thought to control the sources
of water and the fertility of which it was the symbol; a slaying
to be accomplished, and a woman who was at once a fertility
symbol and a vicarious sacrifice. The king himself was the
dragon, in its original form just a serpent symbol of his reputed
control over water.</p>

<p>Thus stated the story is understandable, but it becomes confused
and infinitely complex when it is dramatized in the mythology
of ancient Egypt. A king who through his beneficent
irrigation works is identified with the river Nile is translated
by legend into the skies and becomes the water god Osiris, a
member of the earliest Trinity. The second member of the
Trinity, but the first in point of time, is Hathor, the Great
Mother,—at one time identified with the cowry shell, the earliest
form of fertility emblem, and then identified with the moon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and translated into the sky when primitive minds saw the lunar
rhythm repeated in the sex life of woman. The third member
of the Trinity is Horus, the Warrior Sun God, a son of Osiris.
How an aging king, not yet a god, resolved that he would not
be slain to make way for a younger man and called upon the
Great Mother, already a goddess, to provide him with an elixir
of life, which was blood, and how, in compliance with his
entreaty, she nearly wiped out mankind before a substitute was
provided—in reality the red waters of the Nile inundation—is
allegorically recited in the ancient Egyptian narrative called
the Destruction of Mankind.</p>

<p>In this and its companion legends, the Story of the Winged
Disk and the Conflict between Horus and Set, are all the elements
of the dragon saga. It would be futile to recite them in
detail, for the thing has become so confused that in the words
of Doctor Smith it amounts to this: “The early Trinity as the
hero, armed with the Trinity as a weapon, slays the dragon,
which is the same Trinity.” But the confusion has produced a
concrete and comprehensible result, a composite wonder-beast
in which are blended parts of real animals that symbolize both
regeneration and destruction and that are the attributes of the
several members of the early Trinity, and of Set, enemy of
Horus and lord of chaos.</p>

<p>An archaic conception this may seem now, but what is there
of the human or the cosmic that does not lie in it? The desire
for unfading youth and continuing life on one side of the grave
or the other is in it, and that is the heart history of humanity.
The conflict between order and chaos is in it, and that is the
story of nature. The theme of vicarious sacrifice is in it, and
that is the deep mystery of religion. There is that in the tale
which impelled the story-tellers of five millenniums to repeat it,
to enrich its incidents and to weave the tissues of new meanings
through it until it was at once a treatise on astronomy, a theory
of meteorology and a philosophy of destiny; a record of the
strife between winter and summer, night and day, justice and
injustice, and good and evil fates, which is the world as men
have found it.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the dragon of classic story and mediæval
blazonry is the devil of Scripture; the biblical identification is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
complete, and the bird-like features, leathern wings, and forked
tail of this elemental creature of fable all are reproduced in
familiar portraits of the enemy of mankind. This and the
inner meaning of the dragon myth may be accepted, while its
origin in Egypt and dissemination from one place throughout
the world is probable. Doctor Smith, whose contentions are all-embracing,
makes other inferences which here will be outlined
without comment:</p>

<p>The serpent in the Garden of Eden, the tree of life and Eve
herself are all one. The deluge of Sumerian, Babylonian, and
Hebrew legend is a disastrous Nile inundation dramatized. The
ark is the moon-boat of Hathor. The pig owes its evil name to
its identification with Set, who represents the evil side of the
dragon’s nature. The cowry shell, suspended from the girdle
as a fertility emblem and not from any motives of modesty,
became the origin of all clothing. Inland tribes which had no
access to the shore copied the cowry in a plastic yellow metal,
and this was the origin of the world-old quest for gold and the
occasion of its use as money. The object of mummification was
the continuance of life beyond the grave, the purpose in burning
gums and spices was to restore to the mummy the odor and
warmth of life; and these customs, related to each other and to
the theme of the dragon saga, are also related to the development
of architecture, sea trade, and medicine. Jade reached
its mystic estate in China and other lands, because the men who
sought gold for cowry amulets in Turkestan sought jade at the
same time for seals, and in popular thought the two substances
became confused. Through a similar confusion, diamonds
attained in India the value they have since had everywhere.
Pearls ranked beside both because they were thought to be particles
of moon substances, emanations of the moon goddess herself.
The precious metals and precious stones became so not
because of their rarity or beauty, but because of their magical
power as symbols of the divine actors in the dragon story. The
griffin of legend is merely a tentative dragon. The mandrake
of legend is merely a stranded pearl shell, and the dog used to
extract it from the earth is a terrestrial version of the Mediterranean
dogfish to which had been transferred the demoniac powers
of the sharks that guarded the pearl treasures of the east.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
With the dragon began the unending search for the elixir of life.</p>

<p>These conclusions, some of which offer novel explanations
for enigmatical things noted in this study, are at least a testimony
that the dragon myth has traveled far, and in its travels
has become related to many things. It is the most vital of all
growths that have found root in the fecund soil of the imagination.
It is a richly pictorial history of the groping sublimities
of human thought. The dragon is one of two portraits which
man has painted of himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c8">Chapter VIII. Denizens of the Deep</h2>
</div>

<p>
<span class="smcap large">Belief</span> that the sea was in every respect like the land, and that
its very waves were only a thicker atmosphere, was the main
source of marine fable. In Celtic story, for example, Manannan
sings to Bran that what he is sailing across is not the sea
but a flowery plain, and the speckled salmon are lambs and
calves. Mældune, voyaging over the ocean, descries beneath
him a country with castles, people, and cattle. In the <i>Pih T’an</i>
it is said that in the midst of the waters off Shantung there is
sometimes the misty semblance of a palace, with towered walls
about it, and the appearance of men and carriages and horses
busily engaged; and this is called the Market of the Sea.</p>

<p>It was long held that every land animal had its counterpart
in the ocean. So there had to be mermen to match the men of
the land. Such names as sea-mice, sea-spiders, sea-kites, sea-hares,
sea-dragons, sea-lions, sea-oxen, and sea-horses, “the
grisly wasserman” and “the horrible sea-satyr,” are the records
of old belief. Pliny tells of a number of strange marine creatures,
including elephants and rams, stranded on a Mediterranean
beach, and of others with the heads of horses, asses, and
bulls, which despoiled grain fields beside the Indian Ocean.
The Chinese believed that all domestic animals in the Roman
Orient came out of the sea. Proclaiming that the atmosphere
was only diluted water, De Maillet, a French naturalist of the
eighteenth century, contended that in the ocean was the original
type of everything; that dogs descended from seals and men
from tritons, while parroquets had their brilliant colors from
gold, green, and violet fishes in the sea. There were fierce
tribes of men in the north who seemed to him only lately
emerged.</p>

<p>In classic legend, danger and marvel met mariners upon the
strands along which they sailed in coasting voyages, and there
was no need to go inland for adventure. The sirens sang their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
shrieking songs by the water’s edge, the Polyphemus-folk flung
masses of rock into the breakers, and from their island palaces
enchantresses kept watch for passing ships. The voyages of
fable were thus a sort of parade between shores thronged with
perilous romance. A writing on the Catalan map of 1375 is
in this spirit. In the Spice Islands, it recites, are “three kinds
of sirens—one is half woman, half fish; another is half woman,
half bird; and the third is half woman, half horse.”</p>

<p>Elder fancy peopled the deep itself with tritons riding sea-horses
and stilling the waves with blasts from their shell trumpets,
and with divine nymphs of great beauty and often of
engaging nature, as well as with singular animals. The legate
of Gaul wrote Augustus that a number of nereids had been
found dead on its shore, and men from Olisipo (Lisbon)
brought word to Tiberius that a triton had been heard blowing
a conch shell in a cavern retreat. Sea marvels multiply, but
somehow take on a coarser texture, in the mediæval time.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Sailors’ Favorite</i></p>

<p>Among the marine populations the dolphin has always been
a favorite with sailors, as Greek and Roman bas-reliefs and the
coins, medals, and coats of arms of Mediterranean countries
bear witness. It was supposed to be the swiftest of animals; it
was fond of men and of music, particularly that of the water
organ; it had a turned-up nose, and according to Pliny recognized
in a surprising manner the name of Simo (flat-nose) and
“preferred to be called by that name rather than any other.”
Ajasson thought it was attracted merely by the hissing sound of
the word. Pliny has a tale of its friendship with mankind which
should have a better ending:</p>

<p>“A dolphin at Hippo Diarrhytus on the coast of Africa used
to receive his food from the hands of various persons, present
himself for their caresses, sport about among the swimmers, and
carry them on his back. Proconsul Flavianus rubbed him with
unguents whose odor rendered him as if dead, and he kept aloof
for months afterward, as though affronted. But he returned to
familiar intercourse later. At last the vexations that were
caused them by having to entertain so many influential men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
came to see this sight, compelled the people of Hippo to put the
animal to death.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>Monster Whales</i></p>

<p>The ancients held the great cetaceans in terror. The Talmud
declares that it would take a ship three days to sail from the
head to the tail of Leviathan. Pliny speaks of whales in the
Indian Ocean nine hundred feet long, and of others which
would cover two acres of ground. The traditional fear of them
is in the account by Nearchus of his battle—his own word—with
a school of whales when he was taking Alexander’s fleet
back from the mouth of the Indus to the Persian Gulf. The
sailors saw columns of foam shooting up from the sea and at
first mistook them for waterspouts. When they learned that
these came from whales, “they were so terrified that the oars
fell from their hands.” But Nearchus rallied them, drew up
his ships in order of battle, and at a given signal dashed toward
the monsters. Oars splashed loudly, rowers shouted, trumpets
sang defiance. The astonished whales plunged out of sight, and
his men hailed Nearchus as savior of the fleet.</p>

<p>Sailors in the Indian Ocean of a later time told of the head
of a fish “that might be compared to a hill; its eyes were like
two doors, so that people could go in at one eye and out at the
other.” In these waters Sindbad’s companions mistook a whale
for a green meadow. The whales of Norse lore carry witches,
while the monster that bore Glooskap, the Algonquin culture
hero, could hear the song of clams as they lay under the sand.</p>

<p>St. Brendan and his seventeen monkish brethren repeated the
Sindbad adventure when they sailed into the western seas in
search of the Isle of the Blessed. Bearing a lamb without blemish,
they landed on a low island to celebrate the Easter festival.
But when a fire was lighted and the pot set over it, the island
began to move, and they fled to their osier ship. What they had
taken for an islet was “the beast Jasconius, greatest of things
that swim, which laboureth night and day to put his tail in his
mouth, but for greatness he may not.” In stories of this kind
in the <i>Physiologus</i> the whale was supposed to represent the
devil, the sea the world, and the ship the human race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Kraken</i></p>

<p>“Oh, silly mariners,” exclaimed Arngrim, “that in digging
cannot discern whale’s flesh from earth!” Bishop Pontoppidan
pondered these accounts and in his <i>Natural History of Norway</i>,
published in 1752, he concluded that the whale, large as it
was—and science knows no extinct monster of equal bulk—was
not large enough to explain them. These are not floating
islands, but a vast sea-monster called kraken, kraxen, or krabben.
“What the credulous Olaus Magnus writes,” says he, “of
the whale being so large that his back is looked upon as an
island, and that people might land, light fires, and do various
kinds of work upon it, is a notoriously fabulous and ridiculous
romance.” No, this is the kraken, the back of which “seems to
be about an English mile and a half in circumference.”</p>

<p>People, thinks the bishop, had some imperfect idea of the
kraken for ages back. Pliny heard an obscure account of it in
the Gaditanian sea; he likens it both to a wheel with spokes and
to a tree with such large branches that it could not get through
a ship channel. The Kors Trold or Soe-Drawl which sailors
deemed an evil spirit, and which they said could stop a ship
under full sail, must be the kraken, concludes the Norwegian.</p>

<p>Pontoppidan draws a spirited picture of this prodigious creature
showing itself among a fleet of fishermen. They are several
miles out at sea on a hot summer day. Their lines should show
from eighty to one hundred fathoms of water under them, but
show only twenty or thirty. Fish are plentiful, above all cod
and ling. As fast as the sailors cast in they draw out their finny
prey. They are angling right over the monster, and his back
is the bottom the lines have sounded. Then they see the water
shallowing still further; the kraken is raising himself. So they
hasten out of danger and lie on their oars.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes,” says the historian, “they see this enormous
monster come up to the surface of the water; he there
shows himself sufficiently, though his whole body does not
appear, which in all likelihood no human eye ever beheld. His
back looks at first like a number of small islands, surrounded
with something that floats and fluctuates like seaweeds; and several
bright points or horns appear, which grow thicker and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
thicker the higher they rise above the water. Sometimes they
stand up as high and as large as the masts of middle-sized vessels.
These are the creature’s arms, and it is said if they were
to lay hold of the largest man-of-war, they would pull it down
to the bottom. After this monster has been on the surface a
short time, it begins slowly to sink again, causing a whirlpool
that draws down everything with it.”</p>

<p>Pontoppidan believes the kraken is a polypus, one of the starfish
kind. It has a strong and peculiar scent by means of which
it attracts other fish. Those islands, among the Faroes, that suddenly
appear and as suddenly disappear and that people deem
inhabited by evil spirits are krakens.</p>

<p>All of which is set down in the famous eighth chapter of the
<i>Natural History</i> which, as its author says, “treats of the Norwegian
Sea-Monsters, or those animals of enormous size and
uncommon form which are sometimes seen in the ocean.” In
this chapter the Norse cleric seeks seemingly to outmatch in the
colder seas of Scandinavia the marvels of the Mediterranean.
He makes himself chief sponsor for the sea-serpent. He
describes the trold-fish, or unlucky-fish, that sailors hasten to
throw overboard. He has much to say of mermaids. He tells
of the Maelstrom in the Lofoden district of Nordland—an abyss
which penetrates the globe and issues in the Gulf of Bothnia;
“within a Norway mile of it, boats, ships, and yachts have been
carried away.” Whales are sometimes swept into it, “and then
it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Sea Serpent</i></p>

<p>The sea serpent of Pontoppidan has a venerable past and a
present of conjecture and recurrent report. Insensibly a legend
has been built up in the modern time as strange as any in the
whole range of fable. Men say, not “a sea serpent,” but “the
sea serpent.” It is assumed that there is but one, and that for
ages it has haunted the deep, appearing sometimes in the
Atlantic, sometimes in the Indian Ocean, sometimes in the South
Pacific—a plesiosaurus, perhaps, wandering the seas, the lonely
survivor of a vanished age.</p>

<p>Olaus Magnus described the great marine snake—the Soe-Ormen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
of old lays—as two hundred feet long and twenty feet
around, and as rising up like a mast before ships and snapping
men off their decks. Hans Egede, the Greenland missionary,
saw it in July, 1734. When it reared itself, its head was higher
than the ship’s maintop. When it flattened itself upon the
water, its tail was a ship’s length behind its head. “The following
evening,” says Mr. Egede, “we had very bad weather.”</p>

<p>From all accounts, Pontoppidan concludes that this monster
is of about the length of a cable, or six hundred English feet.
The body is as big around as two hogsheads. “The head has
a high and broad forehead, but in some a pointed snout, though
in others that is flat, like that of a cow or horse; with large blue
eyes like a couple of bright pewter plates, large nostrils, and
several stiff hairs standing out on each side like whiskers.” Its
skin is smooth, except for a mane, like seaweed.</p>

<p>These great snakes, the Norse writer declares, haunt the floor
of the North Sea, rising in July and August, their spawning
time. The wind is destructive to them, and they appear only
in calms. They cannot face the sun, and the fisherman may
escape them by rowing toward it. Nor can they endure the
smell of castor or asafœtida, and anglers who go out on Stor
Eggen in the summer provide themselves with one or the other.
Sometimes, however, the monster rises under small boats and
upsets them, or throws its heavy folds across vessels even of
some hundred tons burthen, and sinks them.</p>

<p>The appearances of the sea serpent are well enough documented.
It was reported off the Norway coast in 1819, 1822
and 1837, off the New England coast in 1815, 1817, 1819,
1833, and 1869, and off the American coast farther south in
1895. It was seen in the South Atlantic in 1841 by the frigate
<i>Dœdalus</i>, and in 1875 by the bark <i>Pauline</i>, when seemingly it
was dragging under a large whale. A few years ago it was seen
by the bark <i>Harvard</i> near Borneo. In the nineteenth century it
was sighted so often near Boston that it became known as the
American sea serpent. The accounts were circumstantial and
so well vouched for that there could be no reasonable doubt
that a strange marine monster was abroad. A committee of the
Boston Linnaean Society, for example, drew up a report signed
by eye-witnesses in 1819. The serpent, they said, was from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
eighty to ninety feet long, with buoy-like protuberances on its
back and was swimming at twenty miles or more an hour, and
driving frightened mackerel before it.</p>

<p>These reports have been variously explained—that a low-ranging
flight of sea fowl could produce the semblance of a
snake upon the water; that a mass of seaweed had created this
effect; that a pair of gigantic basking sharks, swimming in a
line, had seemed to be one creature; that twenty-foot ribbon fish
were the basis of the legend, and that a monster squid had been
mistaken for a snake. The preponderance of scientific opinion
inclines to the last named view. Cephalopods more than sixty
feet long have been seen off Newfoundland and the coasts of
northern Europe, and it may be that what the <i>Pauline</i> saw was
not a serpent crushing a whale, but a whale killing a giant cuttle
fish. But it is not at all certain that a monster of some
species unknown, or too hastily assumed to be extinct, a stray
from the Mesozoic or Eocene seas, does not haunt the ocean.</p>

<p>Cousins of this prodigy, of vaguer outline, rove the deeps of
myth and romance. The sea serpent of Arab story is the waterspout.
The spotted snake of Navajo story caused the flood.
The bunyip of Van Diemen’s Land carried off women to his
water abode. The yacu-mama, or mother of waters, of Brazilian
story—fifty paces long and twelve yards in girth—drew
anything within a hundred yards into its jaws, but could be placated
by bugle music. The orc of the Charlemagne cycle, a
horrible mass of tossing and twisting body with nothing of the
animal but head, eyes, and tusked mouth, haunted an island off
the Irish coast and menaced the manacled and beauteous Angelica.
Rogero with his hippogrif and magic buckler released her,
and Orlando slew the monster afterward. The killing by a Moslem
of a like creature that had been devouring beautiful virgins
led to the conversion of the Maldive islanders, according
to Ibn Batuta; at times it reappears in the offing in the seeming
of a ship with lighted candles. The orc of science is no
serpent, but a large dolphin, and when it pursues the whale,
says an old writer, the latter makes “a hideous bellowing, like
a bull when bitten by a dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>Tortoises</i></p>

<p>A quaint humor animates much of tortoise tradition. By
stringing cords across a tortoise shell the infant Hermes invented
the lyre. According to the Sicilians a tortoise executed the
decree of fate that Æschylus should die of a blow from heaven;
an eagle mistook the tragic poet’s bald head for a stone and
dropped a tortoise upon it to break the shell. Pliny says that
tortoises betray themselves to fishermen by overeating at night
on land and snoring loudly after they return to the water.
“Some persons are of opinion,” he reports, “that the female
refuses to have any intercourse with the male until he has placed
a wisp of straw on her back, and that she hatches her eggs
merely by looking at them.” From the tortoise the Romans
obtained no less than sixty-six remedies for bodily ills.</p>

<p>Sea turtles may attain a weight of a thousand pounds, and
legend has enlarged this figure. In their shells, says Diodorus,
the Chelonophagi (turtle-eaters) of the East African islands,
sailed to the mainland for fresh water. They used them also
as roofs, nature’s bounty providing them “by one gift food,
vessels, shipping, and habitations.” Ælian speaks of tortoise
shell houses fifteen cubits long: “nor does the rain beating
against them sound otherwise than if it were falling on tiles.”
Odoric overtops this. In Cochin-China he saw a tortoise “bigger
in compass than the dome of St. Anthony’s Church in
Padua.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>Eels</i></p>

<p>The Romans thought that the murænas, or sea eels, had a
language of their own, and that their voices were “low and
sweet, with an intimation so fascinating that few could resist
its influence.” The Emperor Augustus, it was believed, could
understand the language. How eels were generated was long a
puzzle, their origin being imputed to May dew, horse hairs,
rocks, mud, the carcasses of animals, and even to Jove and the
goddess Anguilla; hence their scientific name of <i>Anguillina</i>.
A cod of the German coast and a Sardinian water beetle have
each been called the “eel-mother.” It has lately been ascertained
that the eggs are spawned in Bermuda waters, and the
young reach Europe after a two years’ journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>Three Traditions</i></p>

<p>A German folk-tale has it that when Christ was crucified all
the fishes were terror-stricken and dived under water, save the
pike, which thrust forth its head and witnessed the scene. Hence
the pike’s head shows some of the parts of the crucifixion—the
cross, three nails, and a sword. Another fish, the remora,
decided the fate of the world by attaching itself to Antony’s
galley and keeping it out of the battle line at Actium; or so
says Pliny. There are monstrous crabs on the beaches of
Japan, some of them seven feet across, which bear what seems
to be a human mask on their backs. The natives say they appeared
after a pirate fleet had been destroyed and its leaders
beheaded on the shore.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Water Horses</i></p>

<p>The water gods of northern Europe usually had the horse
form, and their memory survives in Shetlandic tales of the
njogel and tangi. The former appeared as a sleek pony or
decrepit gray horse; its hair grew forward instead of backward;
its fetlocks pointed upward instead of downward; its
hoofs were reversed. At dusk it would stand beside a trail,
and seemed to invite the benighted traveler to mount it. Then
it galloped over a waterfall, or dashed into a lake, leaving him
to drown while it vanished on the other bank in a blue light.
The tangi was like it, but had its ranging ground on the seashore.
People became insensible for days when it ran around
them.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Sharks</i></p>

<p>Human attributes among the sea’s inhabitants are divided
between sharks and the merfolk. The latter are the graceful
creatures of an imagination at play with itself. The former
are always things of terror, not only because they attack man,
but because they seem to have some special and sinister relation
to him. They have been thought to be enchanted men.
Savages tell of their taking human form and human mates.
The West African sacrificed children to a shark god. In the shark
temples of the Sandwich Islands priests rubbed their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
bodies with salt water so as to seem to have scaly skins. Offerings
of coins were made to the basking shark in northern
Europe. In New Calabar it was a capital offense to kill a shark.
Sailors still think that this fish will follow vessels on which
some one is to die, and in the days of the slave ships it was
said to have a special fondness for the flesh of blacks. In
former times its teeth, set in gold, were used as amulets and
its powdered brains had a place in medicine; shark’s oil is still
in the pharmacopœias, shark fins are a Chinese dainty, and
shark skins an article of commerce. The source of these beliefs
and practices may be in the world-wide dragon myth, wherein
pearls were thought to be emanations of the moon goddess and
were sought as givers of life. The sharks that harassed the
pearl fisheries came to be looked upon as demons guarding the
treasure houses of the sea floor, and embodiments of evil like
the dragon itself.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Merfolk</i></p>

<p>Under mermaid legend is the old notion that because there
are men and women on the land there must be men and women
in the sea. The texture of the legend has become about as complex
as human nature itself, and, like it, shows the divine, the
semi-divine and the coarsely animal subsisting together. In
turn the mermaid has been goddess, enchantress, and fresh meat
at sea.</p>

<p>The oldest known form of the myth may be glimpsed on tavern
signs, where the mermaid is depicted with a circular mirror
in her hand and a fish tail. She is Chaldean and Phœnician.
Derceto, the moon goddess, was represented as half woman and
half fish because it was conceived that she divided her time
between the earth and the waters under the earth, plunging into
the sea with every moonset. Baring Gould thinks that the mirror
she holds may be the moon disk.</p>

<p>Other shapes of poetry were merged in the legend before it
entered the prose period of maritime discovery. Among them
were the tritons and the nereids, “half-naked, natural, loving,
and antique”—lesser divinities of classic fable. At some time
the sirens, who had been pictured as half human and half bird,
were immersed, and thereafter were pictured as half human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
and half fish. Browne protests this representation, but the mermaid
myth does carry siren features, song included. The song
of the Rhine maidens is mermaid song, their prophecy mermaid
prophecy. Of the same family are the nixies who love music
and foretell the future.</p>

<p>The legend has become further entangled—with tales of banshees
whose wailing portends death, of gull-befriended seal people
who could take human form, of swan maidens who wed mortals,
of forward sea fairies who leave their red caps on the
shore of Ireland for young men to pick up, even of the female
demon or nightmare. There are both foam and cloud-flock in
mermaid story, and they meet in the gentle Phæacian, Nausicaa,
whom Ulysses discovers bathing on the shore.</p>

<p>In Fouqué’s <i>Undine</i> the legend achieves its purest poetry. It
is the story of a nymph who lives with her foster parents on
the edge of an enchanted forest where a knight of the old German
Empire finds and woos her. Riding thither through the
wood, a bear mocks him with human voice from the branches
of an oak, a troll shows him the goblins at play with their gold
beneath the earth, and what seems at one moment a tall white
man and at the next a foaming brook guides him to the cottage.
These were Undine’s familiars, and when the knight meets the
water maiden the brook rises and for days roars about the cottage,
secluding him there until he has won the nymph’s heart,
and she his hand and with it an immortal soul. Through the
remainder of the story until its inevitable disaster in the unwitting
breaking of a vow—the end of all unions between nymphs
and mortals—water foams and flashes and strange shapes dissolve
in spray.</p>

<p>This is the type of a hundred mediæval tales, of which the
best known is that of Melusina, a fountain nymph wedded to
the head of the house of Lusignan, but lost to him because he
did not keep his pledge to respect her Saturday privacy. He
discovered her in the bath, a serpent from the waist downward.
According to report her blood flowed in the veins of the Luxembourg
and Rohan families and in Henry VII, sovereign of the
Holy Roman Empire. Her spirit was seen whenever the death
of a Lusignan impended. The tale has an extensive bibliography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Other accounts of water maidens are of a wilder cast. The
judy of Slavic folk tales lived in the lakes and rivers of the
Rhodope Mountains and danced in meadows, and him whom
they coaxed to dance with them they destroyed. When they
saw a man in the water they entangled him in their long hair
and drowned him. The pariks of Armenian story are erotic
female demons of the river banks. In a Celtic tale Rath saw
mermaids as “grown-up girls, the fairest of shape and make
above the waters; but huger than one of the hills was the hairy-clawed,
bestial lower part which they had beneath.” They sang
the hero to sleep and tore him to pieces. The ships of another
Celtic adventurer, Ruad, were stopped, and when he went over
the side he saw “three of the loveliest of the world’s women”
holding to the keels; the rest of the story is dalliance. Pacific
coast Indians have legends of beautiful, long-haired women
who lived in a round house under the ocean and made trouble
for people above. An Arab traveler tells of joyous water maidens
caught and caressed by sailors in the bright straits of
Greece, and then returned to the sea.</p>

<p>The prose of the legend was reached when men began to
capture what they conceived to be mermaids and mermen, and
failed in most cases to find kindred beings. There is a considerable
list of these creatures captured or sighted on the beaches
of the Old and the New World. Only one of these talked, and
Pontoppidan mentions the story but to discredit it. Two senators
of Norway caught a merman, but let him go on his threatening
them in Danish to sink the ship with all its crew. Of the
so-called bishop-fish or sea bishop, said to have been netted for
the King of Poland in the Baltic in 1453, a similar tale is told.
It wore a dalmatic and mitre and carried a crosier. With gestures
of entreaty it besought the intercession of its brother
prelates of the court. When it was released into the sea the
grateful creature made the sign of the cross and gave the episcopal
benediction with its fin before it submerged. In one other
instance there were points of human contact. Milkmaids of
Edam in West Friesland in 1430 found a mermaid which had
been swept over the dykes by a storm. They brought it home,
as the story goes, and dressed it in female attire; it learned how
to spin, to eat with them, to adore the crucifix, but it never spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>Through many other accounts runs the belief that merfolk
were weather-breeders. The <i>Speculum Regale</i>, an Icelandic
work of the twelfth century, describes a mermaid with a “very
horrible face” that haunts the deep near Greenland and before
heavy storms is seen with fish in its hands. If it casts the fish
toward the ship, it is an omen of death in the coming storm;
if it casts the fish away from the ship it is a good omen. Hakluyt’s
<i>Voyages</i> tell of a monster, from the middle upward proportioned
like a man and with a tawny skin, which was discovered
near Bermuda in the sixteenth century. The clerks
of the expedition put the account in writing, to be certified to
the English king. “Presently after this,” it is recited, “for
the space of sixteen days we had wonderful foule weather.”
Knud Leems in his account of Danish Lapland asserted that
horrible tempests followed the appearance of a merman and
merwoman in those seas. The male, or hav-manden, was like
a robust man with brown skin and long hair and beard; the
female, or hav-fruen, had the human shape and hair and a
ghastly visage.</p>

<p>It appears that a merman, captured in the Baltic in 1531,
lived for three days at the court of Sigismund, King of Poland,
and there is a story that to determine ownership of another
the King of Portugal and the Grand Master of the Order of
St. James had a suit at law.</p>

<p>Merolla tells of a ship’s crew in a South African port who
saw at a distance “a sort of sea monsters like unto men” gathering
herbs, with which they plunged into the sea. The sailors
gathered herbs for them, and the grateful creatures “forthwith
drew from the bottom of the sea a quantity of coral” and laid it
in the place where the sailors had piled the herbs. Human
perfidy ends a pretty story. The sailors spread a net to catch the
mermen, who lifted it and fled.</p>

<p>The purely animal quality predominates in other of the circumstantial
accounts repeated of the mer people. A merman
was captured off the coast of Suffolk in 1187, but escaped.
Hendryk Hudson reports that his crew saw a mermaid near
Nova Zembla, and “from the navel upward her back and breasts
were like a woman’s,” while the tail was like the tail of a porpoise.
In 1560 fishermen netted seven mermen and mermaids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
in the seas west of Ceylon; several Jesuit priests were witness
thereto. Captain Weddell, the Antarctic explorer, records the
sworn testimony of one of his crew that he had seen a creature
with human form and the tail of a seal, and with red face and
green hair. In the sea of Angola, says Pontoppidan, mermaids
are heard to shriek and cry like women; negroes net and eat
them, and their flesh is considered much like pork. Sigismundus
ab Herbenstein had it from Muscovite sources that in
the river Tachnin there was “a certain fish with head, eyes,
nose, mouth, hands, feete and other members utterly of humane
shape, and yet without any voyce, and pleasant to be eaten.” In
Pinkerton’s <i>Voyages</i> there is an account of the woman fish found
“among the islands Boccias,” the flesh of which is “of excellent
savour when eaten boiled like other meat, and which also
serves to make highly savoury sausages.”</p>

<p>The dugong, manatee, or sea cow has been called the Old
Man of the Sea as well as the mermaid. It has figured in
legends with a biblical background; the people about the Red
Sea took these creatures for survivors or descendants of the
army of Pharaoh that was drowned in pursuing the Israelitish
host. The three mermaids that Columbus saw on his first voyage
to the New World are supposed to have been of this species.
When white men first came to America the manatees thronged
the waters of Florida, but have since become nearly extinct
there, although there is a protected herd in the Miami River.</p>

<p>Reports of actual captures present the rationalization and
degradation of the mermaid legend. The divine daughters of
the deep with their lovely bodies and flowing hair become strange
animals of the seal or cetacean species with ugly faces and
bodies that may be converted into pork—sea apes, as the credulous
and yet cautious Pontoppidan calls them. They grow so
common that the <i>Aberdeen Almanac</i> of 1688 predicts the periods
when mermaids may be expected near the mouth of the Dee.</p>

<p>Sir Humphrey Davy argued that if God had created the
mermaid, her deficient means of locomotion and of self-defense
would have left her a prey to the fish. Yet the seas would have
been poorer of romance if the logic and poetry of men had not
led them to correct, in ages more naïve, what seemed to them
an oversight of their Maker.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c9">Chapter IX. The Peoples of Prodigy</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> his <i>True History</i> Lucian relates what he is at pains to
point out is a fictitious voyage to the moon and to various isles
of the outer seas. Grotesque half-human beings people his
narrative. There are grape vines, the upper parts of which
have the shape of women, and these entwine themselves about
his men. There are Hippogypi, or men carried upon vultures;
Onoscileas, or ass-legged women, with long robes and a free
manner of harlotry; Bucephali, or men with bulls’ heads and
horns and lowing voices; Schorodomachi, or garlic-fighters;
Psyllotoxotæ, or flea-archers; Acroconopes, or gnat-riders;
cloud-centaurs, nut-eaters, pirates riding dolphins that neigh like
horses, and a variety of other fantastic creatures. The Samosatan
wrote, he says, “about such things as neither are nor
ever can be.”</p>

<p>Yet races of men very much like these were long supposed to
live upon earth. Their descriptions are in the ancient histories,
their habitats are defined in the classic geographies, their effigies
are upon mediæval maps. As late as the century after
Columbus, travelers were still coming upon them, and repeating
the interrogatory of <i>The Tempest</i>, “What have we here, a
man or a fish?” Perhaps twoscore of these imaginary tribes
are better documented, and not so long ago were better known,
than most of the tribes of real men and women upon the earth;
the documents are on dusty shelves of the larger libraries.</p>

<p>Some of the singular folk entered literature by the double
gates of mistaken etymology and literal acceptance of figurative
language. In the lineaments of others one discerns races that
are still upon earth, but divested of the masks of fable. In
the rest one sees the creative fancy of man following its natural
bent—cartooning humanity by exaggerating a limb or feature
or by eliminating it; borrowing something from the brute;
making men taller or shorter, or longer-lived or shorter-lived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
than reality; fashioning the moon calves, the Calibans; setting
up a realm in which paradox is law. Thus mankind gave itself
new and interesting neighbors.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Singular Speech</i></p>

<p>Men judge one another by the testimony of the ear as well
as of the eye; and the speech of all these peoples, no less than
their anatomy, proclaimed the law of paradox. Sometimes
the surprise was in hearing Indian or Greek or Arab words from
lips that seemed bestial rather than human. Often no words
came at all, but only unintelligible animal sounds. This, indeed,
was to be expected from races whose bodies varied from
the normal; but the list of prodigious folk is lengthened by the
addition of other men who, while looking like ordinary mortals,
were not quite human in their speech.</p>

<p>There were nations which used dumb-barter because they
had no language. There were tribes in Ethiopia which, as Pliny
says, “have to employ gesture by nodding the head and moving
the limbs instead of speech.” On the Atlantic seaboard were
troglodytes that “have no articulate voice, but only utter a kind
of squeaking noise.” “Like the screeching of bats,” says
Herodotus of the same people. Another tribe of troglodytes,
according to John Lok, “have no speech, but rather a grinning
and chattering.” The Arabians dwell in caves and have shrill,
boyish voices, declares Jordanus. In the eastern mountains of
Ind, says Tauron, are the Choromandæ, a forest folk with hairy
bodies, canine teeth, and sea-green eyes who “screech in a
frightful manner.” Kazwini speaks of hairy little men in
Ramni with a speech like the chirping of birds. Carpini names
among the peoples of Ind the dog-faced men who speak two
words in human wise and bark for the third. There were people
with a small hole in place of the mouth, whose conversation was
a whistling. Among the isles of Maundeville is one “clept
Traconda, where the Folk be as Beasts and unreasonable, and
dwell in Caves; and they eat Flesh of Serpents, and they eat
but little; and they speak Nought, but they hiss as Serpents do.”
In a desert beyond paradise this authority says there are wild
men “that be hideous to look on, for they be horned and they
speak Nought, but they grunt as Pigs.” However, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
speech in that country, for “Popinjays speak of their own
Nature and say ‘Salve’ to Men that go through the Deserts.”</p>

<p>Neither classical nor mediæval relators mention the device
which has given a South African tribe its name, and rumors of
which may have provided a basis for fable. Merolla, who
went to the Congo in 1682, heard that the Hottentots “have not
the gift of human voice, but understand each other by a sort
of hissing tone and motion of the lips.” This is the Hottentot
“click” which the Portuguese called a kind of stammering and
the Dutch likened to the turkey’s gobble. It is made by applying
the tongue to the roof of the mouth, the teeth, or the gums,
and suddenly drawing it back. There are four of these clicks—the
dental, like the smack of a kiss; the palatal, like the tap of
a woodpecker; the cerebral, like the pop of a cork; and the
lateral, like the quack of a duck.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Dog-headed People</i></p>

<p>The Amazon and pygmy, and certain tribes of the satyrs, had
speech entirely human. Because in them credulity has won
unlooked-for triumphs over skepticism, these three peoples, best
known of the races of legend, are reserved for separate treatment
later. The men of another race vie with the Amazons as
figures in plastic art, although only in its more grotesque manifestations.
The Cynocephali, or dog-headed people, writes
Ctesias, are a swarthy and extremely just people living in the
mountains of northern India at the sources of the Hyparkhos.
The tribe numbers about one hundred and twenty thousand persons
and pays tribute to the King of the Indians.</p>

<p>These people have the heads of dogs, but with larger teeth,
and the bodies of men; and they have dog claws. They cannot
use human speech, although they understand it. They converse
with one another by barking, and with other people by
barking and the sign language. They practice no arts but live
by the chase, using the bow and spear; and they can outrun wild
animals. Their staple food is raw flesh, which, however, they
roast in the sun. They rear numbers of sheep, goats, and asses
and drink the milk and whey of the ewes. They are fond of the
fruit of the siptakhora, the tree that produces amber. The
surplus fruit they dry and pack in hampers as the Greeks pack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
raisins. Every year they freight rafts with the hampers and
with two hundred and sixty talents weight of amber, and a like
weight of a pigment which they make from a purple flower.
This they convey as tribute to the Indian king. They ship
other raft-loads of the same commodities to their neighbors, receiving
bread and flour in return and a cloth made from a stuff
grown on trees (cotton). They also sell arms to other peoples.</p>

<p>The dog-headed people are troglodytes, sleeping on a litter
of straw or leaves spread in caves. The women bathe once a
month, the men not at all, merely washing their hands; but
thrice a month they anoint themselves with butter. They are
clad in skins and the richest have cotton raiment. Some of
them live to be two hundred years old.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Andaman Islands, says Marco Polo,
are a savage race “having heads, eyes and teeth resembling those
of the canine species”; and they kill and eat strangers. Odoric
is equally uncomplimentary, but Ibn Batuta, always sensitive
to female charm, says their naked wives are of exquisite beauty.
Carpini speaks of India’s dog-faced men. Even Greenland has
a similar legend as to an older race of barbarians who had
magic, but not the bow and arrow. These were men with dog
paws. They disappeared in battle with the Eskimos, or from
natural causes, since “the world was too small to hold both
races.” Myths of dog descent are found among the Aleuts, Dog-ribs,
and Ojibwas in North America, as well as in Madagascar,
Java, the Nicobars, New Guinea, Indo-China, and even Europe.
In North America the wild dog (coyote) frequently figures as
the creator of mankind.</p>

<p>Sunamukha is the Indian name of the Cynocephali, and a
manuscript of the Prabhâsakhanda recites that this people lives
on the Indus. What Ctesias has set down seems to be an account
of an actual race, a tribe of black aborigines.</p>

<p>When Hayton, the intrepid traveler-king of Armenia, paid a
visit in the thirteenth century to Batu, the Mongol prince, he
brought back a related and still stranger story. Beyond Cathay,
a journey of two years and two months from Nakin, was a country
where the women had the human shape and speech, but the
men were like hairy dogs and had no speech. These dog-men
repelled all strangers from their land, and supported themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
and their wives by the chase, the men eating flesh raw, the women
cooking it. When children were born, the males had the shape
of dogs, the females that of women. The <i>Chinese Encyclopedia</i>
also has a tale of the Kingdom of Dogs, and it was a Chinese
traveler who broke up this curious commonwealth. The women
wished to escape from it and gave him little sticks, asking him,
when he went back to his native land, to drop one of these every
ten li. They got away by the trail he marked.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The One-Eyed Arimaspians</i></p>

<p>Lying between the gold-guarding griffins and the cannibal
Issedones was the country of the one-eyed Arimaspians. They
first appear in a poem of Aristeas of Proconesus, a semi-mythical
person who made a northward journey, as his verses declare,
in a mood of “bacchic fury.” Herodotus bases his account
on these, but cannot persuade himself that there is a race
of men born with one eye who in all else resemble the rest of
mankind. Arimaspi, he says, is a word of Scythic origin, a
compound of <i>arima</i> (one) and <i>spou</i> (eye).</p>

<p>There Herodotus drops the legend, and after it has thriven
in the tales of the fabulists for some thousands of years, modern
criticism takes it up again from the same angle. It is suggested
that, after all, Arimaspi never meant one-eyed, and that the
race, the tradition of whose deformed aspect arose from a mistaken
translation of its name, is still in existence in the Russian
tribe known as the Tsheremis, which occupies the left bank of the
Middle Volga. This is near enough to the Ural gold districts
to meet the general topography of the legend.</p>

<p>Strabo also describes a one-eyed nation, the Monomatti, with
the ears of dogs, bristling hair, and shaggy breasts.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Folk That Live on Odors</i></p>

<p>The folk that live on odors dwell, says Megasthenes, near
the sources of the Ganges. They have no mouths, hence their
name of Astomi. Their bodies are rough and hairy and they
clothe themselves with a down plucked from trees—silk or
cotton. They use neither meat nor drink and subsist only by
breathing and by inhaling scents. When they start on a long
journey they lay in a supply of odoriferous roots, flowers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
apples. But, says Pliny, “an odor which is a little more powerful
than usual easily destroys them.” Pope’s “die of a rose in
aromatic pain” may define such a fate.</p>

<p>According to other ancient writers the Astomi also supported
life by sniffing at raw meat, and their susceptibility to rank
smells made it hard to keep them alive in camp. In Ethiopia
Pliny places a people that “have the mouth grown together, and
being destitute of nostrils, breathe through one passage only,
imbibing their drink through it by means of a hollow stalk of
the oat, which there grows spontaneously and supplies them with
its grain for food.” Maundeville removes the Astomi to an
island and gives them the stature of pygmies and a hissing
speech.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Noseless Nations</i></p>

<p>There were several noseless nations. The flexible-footed
Scyritae, says Megasthenes, had only two breathing orifices
above the mouth; and he sketches pygmies similarly made.
Maundeville improves on the sketch: “And in another Ile be Folk
that have the Face all flat, all plain, without Nose and without
Mouth.” In contrast still another island had “Folk of foul
Fashion and Shape that have the lip above the Mouth so great
that when they sleep in the Sun they cover all the Face with that
lip.” Megasthenes had named and described these seventeen
centuries before. They were the Amycteres, with upper lips
projecting far beyond the lower—an omnivorous people, fond
of raw meat, and short lived. Tudela tells of desert-ranging,
infidel Turks who worship the wind, eschew bread and cooked
meats, and, lacking noses, breathe through two small holes.
The Noseless People of the Eskimo shore are evil spirits that
drag fishermen to gloomy abodes under the sea.</p>

<p>To men with the bold Roman profile, the Levantine contour,
or the scimitar-shaped visage of the Sephardic Jew, Tartary’s
small-nosed, flat-faced peoples would indeed present a countenance
very like a plane surface. The scanty hair of the same
peoples may be responsible for the ancient notion of bald northern
nations. The Eskimo legend suggests a skeleton tenanted
by a demon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>Large-eared Races</i></p>

<p>An Indian race called the Enotocoitæ had ears hanging down
to their feet—“great Ears and long that hang down to their
Knees” is for once the more restrained phrase of Maundeville.
The philosophers who had told Megasthenes of so many interesting
folk told him also of these. They could sleep upon their
ears as upon a rug, or under them as under a canopy, or inside
them as in a sleeping bag. These appendages were like
winnowing fans, Tzetzes puts it. Their owners were so strong
they could pluck up trees. So could the elephant, which also
has flapping ears and a prolonged upper lip—the pattern, it
would seem, for at least two fables.</p>

<p>Ctesias describes a people who could blanket the upper parts
of their bodies with their ears. These were the Pandore, a
mountain race who lived to be two hundred years old, yet were
destined evidently to become extinct, for they numbered only
thirty thousand persons and the women bore children but once.
The infants were hoary-headed at birth, but at thirty the hair
began to turn black, and at sixty no white hairs were left. Five
thousand bowmen and spearmen of the tribe followed the Indian
king. There was even a Scandinavian tribe with all-enveloping
ears, if Pliny had it right.</p>

<p>To the west of the Troglodytes in distant mountains of Ind,
says Ctesias, live tribesmen who are without necks and have
eyes in their shoulders. In the north of Africa, says Pliny, are
the Blemmyes who “are said to have no heads, their mouths
and eyes being seated in their breasts.” These were also
called the Acephalites. Maundeville shifts their habitat. They
occupy one of fifty-four great isles under the jurisdiction of the
king of Dondun. This island is somewhere toward the south of
Asia. In it dwell “Folk of foul Stature and of cursed Nature
that have no Heads. And their Eyes be in their Shoulders, and
their Mouths be round shapen, like an Horse-shoe amidst their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Breasts.” The <i>Arabian Nights</i> locates these same people in the
City of Brass. Abu Mohammed, hight Lazybones, in quest of
his wife, who has been carried thither by a Marid, “heard a noise
of cries and found himself in the midst of a multitude of folk
whose eyes were in their breasts.” They gave him the news he
sought and volunteered, “Now we be brethren of the white
serpent.” The Eskimos speak of a headless people living in
the moon and in remote regions of the earth.</p>

<p>Here is a story of a curious race domiciled by various writers
in various parts of the Old World, and yet lacking details to
give it verisimilitude. These are supplied by Sir Walter Raleigh
in his report on the wonders of Guiana. The headless people
are Indians of the tribe of Ewaipanoma living in a district near
the Orinoco. He has seen none of them, but “every childe in the
provinces” affirms the story. Their eyes are in their shoulders,
their mouths in the middle of their breasts, “and a long traine of
haire groweth backward between their shoulders.” A chief’s
son whom they had made a prisoner told Raleigh they were
“the most mighty men of all the land, and use bowes, arrowes,
and clubbes thrice as big as any of Guiana.” This confirms,
concludes Raleigh, what was written of them by “Mandevile,
whose reports were holden for fables many yeeres.”</p>

<p>In the interior of Guiana Sir Walter had a trading transaction
with a nation of kindred appearance. He bartered jew’s-harps
for fowls at a town of five hundred houses, where he found
Indians plentifully provisioned with venison, fowls, and wine.
He asked their chief “whence hee had those Hennes.” The
answer was that they were brought from a mountain less than
a mile away, “where were many Indians, yea so many as grasse
on the ground, and that these men had the points of their
shoulders higher than the Crownes of their heads, and had so
many Hennes as was wonderful; and if wee would have any
wee should send them Jewes harpes, for they would give for
every one two Hennes. Wee tooke an Indian, and gave him
five hundred Harpes; the Hennes were so many that hee brought
us, as were not to be numbered.” Raleigh wanted to visit these
mountain Acephali, but was warned that they were in their
drunken feasts and would kill him.</p>

<p>One may explain the headless peoples about as one will. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Tartar tribes north of India certainly have short necks. Thus
Pliny on the African Acephalites: “On the invasion of the Persians
the Blemmyes were in the habit of falling on one knee
and bowing the head to the breast, by which means, without injury
to themselves, they afforded a passage to the horses of the
enemy.” Buffon accepts and interprets the Raleigh tale. “This
monstrous deformity cannot be natural,” he says. “It is probable
that savages, who are so pleased in disfiguring nature by
flattening, rounding, and lengthening the head, might likewise
contrive to sink it into the shoulders. These fantasies might
arise from an idea that, by rendering themselves deformed, they
became more dreadful to their enemies.” This passage would
have interested Sir Walter.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Half-men</i></p>

<p>There were people in the Philippines whose bodies suffered
temporary subtraction at the other extremity. These were the
asuangs—men who had acquired powers of sorcery by eating
human livers. When they willed it their persons divided at
the waist line, the lower part remaining behind and the upper
growing wings and long nails and a horrible black tongue, and
flying away on vampire errands. An orifice in the armpit contained
an oil which rendered this human bat invisible. If salt
was cast on his abandoned half he could not assemble himself
on his return. Wak-wak was one of his names. The reality
behind this grim fiction was the learned counselor, called the
asuang, whom each datto had at his court before the Spaniards
came. His evil repute is a Spanish slander.</p>

<p>If there were men whose stature had been reduced as by a
transverse sweep of the knife, there were others whose appearance
was as if they had been sliced. These were the half-men
of Moslem legend called the Shikh and the Nesnas, each
with a single arm, leg, and eye, as though one man had been
split in twain. The Zulus had the same story, perhaps from
Moslem sources. They tell of half-men discovering a Zulu girl
in a cave and thinking her two persons. When they discovered
their error they exclaimed: “The thing is pretty! But, oh,
the two legs!” The fable may have sprung from figurative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
speech, in which men of backward culture are described as
only half-men.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Diminutive Husbands</i></p>

<p>American Eskimo legends tell of a tribe called Ardnainiq
living far to the northwest, whereof the men, small as children
and covered with hair, were carried around in the hoods of their
wives, who were of normal size. The detail oddly parallels
Darwin’s statement that he had found a female crustacean of
the common cirripedial character, “and in two valves of her
shell she had two little pockets, in each of which she kept a
little husband.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>Eel-like Men</i></p>

<p>A race of eel-like men, says Julius Scaliger, dwell in Malabar.
They have the serpent’s form, are eight feet long, and,
while of horrible aspect, are harmless unless provoked. They
will “stand bolt upright for hours together, gazing on the boyes
at their sportes, never offring to hurte any of them.” In the
upright posture they lose the likeness of serpents and “spread
themselves into such a corpulent breadthe, that had they feet
they would seeme to be men.” This is a tale brought to Europe
by the Portuguese; and at a time when it was debated whether
the serpent assumed a human form in tempting Eve, it was
thought this might be the creature whose body Satan borrowed.</p>

<p>The tale is based in part on the cobra’s power to dilate its
neck into a broad hood. Back of it are Buddhist traditions of
the Nagas, a race of serpents that lived in dragon palaces under
the earth. There were naga-kings, and naga-maidens who assumed
human form, had their mortal lovers, and became the
founders of dynasties. The original inhabitants of the Andamans
were reputed to have been of this race, and according
to a popular belief their descendants were oviparous. The
interpretation of this legend is complicated by the surmise that
the Nagas were actually an ancient, non-Aryan people whose
emblem was the cobra.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Strangely Footed Folk</i></p>

<p>Certain races the ancients classified and named according to
their means of getting over the ground. With his instinct for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
balanced statement Pliny unearths a passage from Eudoxus
which says that “in the southern parts of India” the men have
feet a cubit in length, “while those of the women are so remarkably
small that they are called Struthopodes.” The word
may mean either “sparrow-footed” or “ostrich-footed.” In the
context it probably means the former; the dames with diminutive
feet hopped around as sparrows do. It may be they were
Chinese women.</p>

<p>Near the Indian troglodytes, according to Ctesias, dwelt the
Monocoli, who had only one leg, but were able to leap with
surprising agility. These people were also called the Sciapodes,
which means “making a shadow with the foot.” It was their
custom in the time of extreme heat to lie on their backs and
shield themselves from the sun, each under the shade of his
own foot. A later century knew the shadow-footed folk as the
men with parasol feet. Maundeville places them in Ethiopia.
In Armenia, or bordering upon it, the Mongols found another
one-legged nation, but with different structure. Its citizens had
only one arm also, which was attached to the middle of the
breast, but they had two gaits. Hopping, they covered ground
with remarkable speed, and when tired of hopping the men and
women whirled themselves around like cartwheels.</p>

<p>When the Norsemen were exploring America, they encountered
a Uniped, or one-legged man, who launched a lethal arrow
at Thorwald Ericson, as he sat at the boat helm. The dying
leader drew it out and exclaimed, “There is fat around my
paunch; we have hit upon a faithful country, and yet we are
not like to get much profit by it.”</p>

<p>The stiff-legged men, Carpini heard, lived south of the country
of the Kara-Khitai, upon a great desert. They had no speech
and no joints in their limbs, and when they fell down somebody
had to help them up. They wore felt of camel’s hair and
made wind shelters thereof. When wounded in battle they
stanched the blood with grass and fled swiftly away.</p>

<p>A related tale is told by Rubruquis, who had it from “a certain
priest of Cathaya who sat with me clothed in a red-coloured
cloth.” When the friar asked him whence he had such a color,
“he told me that in the east part of Cathaya there were high
craggy rocks, wherein certain creatures dwell, having in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
parts the shape of men, but that they bow not the knees, but
leap instead of walking; which are not above one cubit long,
and their whole body is covered with hair, who have their abode
in caves, which no man can come unto; and they who hunt them,
go to them, and carry strong drink with them, and make pits
in the rocks like wells, which they fill with that strong drink.
The hunters hide themselves, and then these creatures come out
of their holes and taste the drink, and cry ‘chin-chin’ and drink
till they are made drunk, so that they sleep there. Then the
hunters come and bind them hand and foot, while they are
sleeping, and afterwards open the veins in their neck and draw
forth three or four drops of blood from every one, and let them
go free; and that blood, as he told me, is the most precious
purple.”</p>

<p>Megasthenes describes a race of Indians living upon a mountain
called Nulo, who had their feet turned backward with the
heel in front and with eight toes on each foot. Pliny places
this race “beyond the other Scythian Anthropophagi in a country
called Abarimon situate in a certain great valley of Mount
Imaus” (Himalayas). They had great rapidity of movement
and wandered about indiscriminately with the wild beasts. The
fable may have originated in the Caucasus, where there is still
a tradition that dæmons take the shapes of armed men, and have
their feet reverted. Farther north dwelt an ox-footed race.</p>

<p>Classic note is made of two writhing nations. The Scyritæ
of India who “have merely holes in their faces instead of
nostrils” have “flexible feet like the body of the serpent,” says
Megasthenes. There was also the thong-footed people or Himantopodes,
residents of northern Africa, who moved with a
serpentine, crawling gait. This may be a traveler’s impression
of some sinuous dance of the desert.</p>

<p>Under the hand of Maundeville the centaurs pass out of mythology
into history. The “Folk that have Horses’ Feet” are in
his collection of marvelous islanders: “And they be strong and
mighty and swift Runners, for they take wild Beasts with Running
and eat them.” These are the Hippopodes of Pliny, tenants
of a Baltic island. A related folk are the islanders permanently
mounted on ostriches, with which they seem to form one body.
Kazwini, who records this Arab legend, says they devour the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
bodies of drowned persons cast up by the sea. On another isle
Sir John seems for the once to have invented a people rather
than revived a legend. Here be “Folk that go always upon
their Knees full marvellously. And at every Pace that they
go, it seemeth that they would fall.”</p>

<p>In Ethiopia, “on that side of the Nile which extends along
the borders of the Southern Ocean,” Pliny domiciles the Artabatitæ,
who have four feet and wander about after the manner
of wild beasts. Maundeville is more detailed: “And they be
all skinned and feathered, and they would leap lightly from
Tree to Tree.” Farther south were the Aigamuxa, theme of a
Hottentot story cycle, whose eyes were in the back of their feet.
Regarding human beings as zebras, they hunted them down and
tore them to pieces.</p>

<p>Chinese marvel tales describe a race of people living somewhere
in the west. They have a hole right through their bodies
at the breast. When their mandarins would take the air, they
thrust a stick through the aperture, and two domestics carry them
so. “If the bearers are strong enough,” says Huc, “they often
string on several gentlemen at once.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>In the Russian East</i></p>

<p>There was an east other than the sun-bathed lands whose
fabulous peoples are in literature. It lay just beyond northern
Europe, on the farther flanks of the Urals and beside the
Obi. To the Russians of the Middle Ages it was a land of
strange races and weird happenings. About these a body of
legends grew up which in a measure parallel the classic stories,
but give them backgrounds of ice and snow and add new
actors and enriching details. A Russian manuscript of the fifteenth
century, found at Novgorod a few years ago and entitled
“The Unknown Peoples of the East,” pictures these forgotten
folk. Nine different races, all called Samoyeds, are described,
and six are races of marvel.</p>

<p>There were Samoyeds who shed their skins like snakes. For
a month each year they stayed in the water, avoiding dry land,
lest their bodies crack open. The Russian anthropologist, Professor
Anutschin, whose interpretation of the narrative is followed
here, says that these are natives who fish and hunt in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
the watery domain of the tundras, where the summer attacks of
mosquitoes and horse flies give their skins a rough and bloody
aspect, as if cracking before sloughing off. There were also
Samoyeds like other people from the navel up, but all shaggy-haired
from the navel down—in reality wearing trousers of
reindeer skins with the hair outside. There were other and
speechless Samoyeds with their mouths on the top of their
heads. When they would eat, says the Novgorod manuscript,
“they crumble the meat or fish, stick it under their fur caps and
then move their shoulders up and down.” This is the account
of a people whose speech the Russians did not understand, who
wore the head skin of the reindeer, ears and all, for a cap, and
whose sack-like garments had collars so high as to conceal their
mouths.</p>

<p>There were also headless Samoyeds with eyes in their breasts
and the mouth between the shoulders, and their diet was raw
reindeer heads and bones; in warfare and the chase their weapon
was an iron tube through which they drove an iron arrow by
hitting it with a hammer. This, it is thought, was an early race
of ironworkers who wore peaked head-caps which concealed the
shoulder line and made the face of the wearer seem to be in
the breast. Another explanation is that several Siberian tribes
had faces painted on the leathern fronts of their garments. The
descriptive phrase, “with the face upon the breast,” might easily
become “headless” when translated into Russian.</p>

<p>Then there was a strange Samoyed race—an independent
creation of Russian fantasy—the members of which died every
winter and revived two months afterward, if let alone. When
the fatal hour had come, they sat down and a stream of water
gushed from their nostrils and froze to the ground. If a stranger
came from another land and broke this icicle or removed it,
the Samoyed never woke up. If he merely jarred it, the refrigerated
native would open his eyes and ask, “Why, little
friend, have you disfigured me?” Others were brought to life
by the warmth of the spring sun. According to a German writer
the day of death was November twenty-seven and revival came
on the twenty-third day of the following April. It is supposed
that the wooden idols scattered over the Obi country, three
hundred of them on a single river island, were the basis of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>curious story. Covered with ice and drifted snow, they looked
human enough, and there were native reports that these were
ancestral Samoyeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f10">
<img src="images/fig10.jpg" alt="cosmic">
<p class="caption"><i>The First People Engaged in Such Cosmic Adventures as Warfare<br>
Against Stone Giants</i></p>
</div>

<p>One race of Samoyeds, says the Novgorod manuscript,
travels day and night with torches by underground ways and
comes out upon a sea over which a strange light falls and beside
which is a great fortress and a deserted city. When the
stranger approaches he hears a tumult in the streets, but, entering,
he sees no one and the clamor dies away. In each house,
however, there are things for him to eat and drink, and other
commodities. He takes what he needs, lays down money in its
stead, and goes his way. Should he fail to make payment,
the wares he takes with him vanish and return to the silent
town. And when the stranger leaves, “then he hears again a
tumult as in other inhabited cities.”</p>

<p>This story has the Celtic magic and might be a chapter from
Malory. It is thought that the mysterious sea is Lake Koliwan
in the western Altais. Granite rocks in the semblance of towers,
terraces, and dismantled fortifications rise from its shores, and
in the hills are the pits and galleries of a copper camp long
abandoned by the Tchudi. These are the underground Samoyed
ways of legend. Perhaps dumb barter was once carried on here.
The radiance across the lake, if not the northern lights, may
have glanced from some Russian tale, like that in which Bishop
Theodor saw the earthly paradise on a mountain side with an
azure light upon it.</p>


<p class="large"><i>New World Prodigies</i></p>

<p>The New World, it has been seen, had its own prodigious
peoples. In Spanish America their legends are overlaid with
imported material, but elsewhere there is little alien alloy.
North America has traditions of stone giants, pygmies, one-eyed
cannibals, hermaphrodites, flint-armored warriors, double-headed
men, dog-headed tribes. There are also storm-raising
mermen, phantom boatmen, underwater folk, otter-men, seal-men,
pug-nosed people, skeletons that resume human shape
at night, talking skulls. Many stories tell of the marriage of
mortals with unearthly beings, of the living with the dead, and
of the union of women with animals. The best known Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
myth has two versions, in one of which the people of the First
Age had human forms but an animal nature, and took the animal
guise before the real men appeared; in the other, which is of
the southwest, the first people had bestial forms but a human
nature, and presently laid aside their animal masks. In the
latter version there was an Amazonian phase in the ascent of
the primitive people. Their women seceded from society and
lived with a water monster. Hunger drove them back, but they
brought into the world a number of prodigious beings whom
their lords had to destroy.</p>

<p>In the First People who had the human form but became animals
the Eastern Algonquins and the Pacific tribes have a myth
which ranks beside the Greek myth of the Titans that were before
Zeus, and the myths of the Golden Age. Its quality is at once
haunting and challenging, the more so because these dawn-folk
are nowhere described. “In old times,” a Micmac Indian told
Leland, “men were as animals and animals as men; how this
was no one knows. But it is told that all were at first men, and
as they gave themselves up to this and that desire, and to naught
else, they became beasts. But before this came to pass, they
could change to one or the other form; yet even as men there
was always something which showed what they were.”</p>

<p>The story cycle of the Mewan Indians of California pictured
the First People as living in great ceremonial houses and engaging
in such cosmic adventures as sun-capture, fire-theft, and
warfare against stone giants. How nearly human and how
much animal they were the Western Indians left in doubt. When
they became animals and went forth from the ceremonial house,
they carried to their future haunts not only their old names, but
their distinctive traits, such as Grizzly Bear’s appetite for acorns,
Frog’s aptitude at water jumps and the clamorous voice of Sandhill
Crane. After the transformation was effected—and only
casual reasons for it are suggested—man was created. Coyote
made him out of feathers, or sticks, or clay, and Lizard gave
him five fingers because he had five himself and knew their
value. In Popol Vuh, the Guatemalan saga, the First People
were manikins that the gods carved out of wood and endowed
with life; but so frivolous and irreverent were these that a flood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
was invoked to destroy them; “the little monkeys that live in the
woods” are descended from survivors.</p>

<p>All over North America were stories of stone giants, and
crudely archaic as are these stalking figures of legend, the myth
has the elemental vigor of Norse epic. According to the
Iroquois, a cannibal race—“stonish giants,” Schoolcraft calls
them—who made their bodies hard by rolling in sand, overran
America seventeen centuries ago, and nearly exterminated
the natives. The Holder of the Heavens took giant form in
order to destroy them. These are the icy-hearted Chenoos of
Algonquin story who lived in northern Canada; in summer they
rubbed themselves with fir balsam and rolled on the ground
so that moss, leaves, and twigs adhered to them. The California
Indians have tales of a cannibal rock-giant who went abroad
with a rock basket on his back into which he tossed people.
There was another stony Titan, tall as a pine tree but vulnerable
under the heel. Only after the First People had killed him by
planting sharp sticks in his path did they elect to become animals.
The theory that these clanking folk typify mountains is
not convincing.</p>

<p>Maundeville has a tale of a bodiless head, but North America
is the true home of this weird legend. Glooskap, culture hero
of the Eastern Algonquins, played at ball with a snapping skull.
There were Indians who went all to pieces leaving only the head,
which ate the other members. Everywhere stories were told
of heads that pursued people and devoured them. The skull
of a mother chased her children over hill and plain. In nightmare
flight the heroes of Indian epic cast obstacles or attractive
things behind them to delay or divert the rolling skull. Reading
a new meaning into the legend, the Arapahoes used it to explain
the railroad.</p>

<p>A Sioux story describes a duel between the Monster and the
Bladder, twin sons of the Turtle. They kept striking off each
other’s heads, and these flew into the sky and, falling back, adhered
again to their necks. But at length Bladder pushed
Monster’s body aside, and the head rebounded, and to this
day it rebounds, for it is the sun, and Bladder is the sky; but
only to old men or wise is this part of the story told. It may
be that these tales derive from the conception of the sun and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
moon as traveling heads, or from the use of a skull as tribal
medicine, or from the war custom of decapitation later supplanted
by scalping, or even from the appearance of the tumbleweed
of the western prairies, which wanders like a ball before
the autumn wind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c10">Chapter X. The Satyrs</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> tail is a symbol of the animal nature. Stories of tailed
humans are found all over the world. They signify a belief that
certain races of men are descended from the apes, or that the
apes are descended from certain races of men. Both beliefs
have been stressed in the modern debate on evolution; yet
neither is new. They are almost the oldest of the philosophical
myths. They trace back to primitive animism—to the notion
that animals are endowed with human intelligence, can understand
the speech of men, and may well be propitiated with worship.
Early man accepted them as cousins. He could change
natures with them, and sometimes it seemed to him he did. Père
Lafitau said of his American flock, “These men are living in
Ovid’s Metamorphoses.”</p>

<p>Sometimes men were content enough with this kinship, erecting
it into totemism, wearing the tail of the buffalo or horse as an
emblem of power. Sometimes they were ashamed of it. They
plucked off all hair from their bodies, because animals were
hairy, and resented it when their women bore them twins, because
the young of animals came in litters instead of singly.
Constantly they confused brute and human nature, using identical
terms of neighbor folk, whether these were apes or men.
The confusion was carried over into literature. One African
tribe was said to have an ape king. There are passages in which
travelers seem to themselves to be speaking of men while to their
readers it is evident they are speaking of monkeys. There are
other passages in which they set out to describe monkeys,
yet draw pictures of men like themselves, but of more primitive
cast. The creatures called satyrs embody this confusion and the
sense of kinship behind it.</p>

<p>According to Isidore, the satyrs have done something to make
their own nature clear. One of them, he says, appearing to St.
Anthony in the desert, explained, “I am mortal, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
inhabitants of the waste, whom the heathen, misled by error,
worship as the Fauns and Satyrs.” He pictures them as manikins
with upturned noses, horns on their foreheads, and goat
feet.</p>

<p>The heathen world, however, never was quite sure what it
meant by the satyrs. If it be true that the fable began with ritual
mummers who donned the nature of fertility dæmons when they
put on the heads of asses, horses, or goats, and danced in them—as
men still do—the memory of this was forgotten. The satyrs
were supposed to be spirits, half human, half bestial, that
haunted woodland and mountain side and fellowshipped with
Pan and Dionysus. They had bristly hair, flat noses, and
pointed ears, with two small horns, and a tail like that of a horse
or goat. Earlier Greek art represented them as ugly, withered,
and ape-like. But Attic sculpture in the time of Praxiteles shows
them with the beast nature well-nigh submerged—graceful figures
instinct with poetry. They took over the attributes of the
kindred sileni, and as Roman influence grew they were confounded
with the fauns and were depicted as half men and half
goats. In Scripture they are the “hairy ones” of Hebrew folklore,
a sort of demon of waste places. So is the word intended
in the prophecy of Isaiah as to Babylon: “Wild beasts of the
desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful
creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance
there.”</p>

<p>Satyrs, as the ancients conceived them, were a wanton, music-loving,
merry-hearted and yet timid folk, their symbol the hare.
They roved about, drinking, dancing to the pipe and cymbal,
pursuing the nymphs, killing the cattle of men and making love
to their women. Men feared them, as embodying the loneliness
of waste places, feared them with the sudden panic fear, which
the apparition of their leader, the leering goat-god, always excited.
Equally, the shy creatures feared men, but not women.
Gradually these timid spirits moved out of mythology into
geography. There were satyr isles, and there were satyr tribes
in distant mountains and deserts, alike in Africa, India, and the
spaces of the sea. Always they were described as avoiding contact
with men, screening themselves in the thickets and seen only
from afar. The satyrs of western Africa, says Pliny, “beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>their figure have nothing in common with the manners of the
human race.” Ælian speaks of Indian satyrs that have human
features, that go sometimes on four feet and sometimes on two
and are too swift to be caught.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f11">
<img src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="satyr">
<p class="caption">A SATYR<br> <i>By</i> Jacob Jordaens</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the classic conception of this creature passes from
spirits of the waste to tailed men, to apes, retracing the path
which Greek art followed from simian beings to spirits of the
waste. These were the wild men and wild women whom Herodotus
locates in western Africa. Hanno, the Carthaginian explorer,
had been before him. His narrative tells of finding an
island full of wild people on the west coast of Africa: “For the
greater proportion were women, whose bodies were covered with
hair, and whom our interpreters called Gorillæ. Though we
pursued the men, we could not catch any of them, since all fled
from us, escaping over the precipices and defending themselves
with stones. However, we took three women, but they attacked
their conductors with their hands and teeth, and could not be
prevailed on to accompany us. We therefore killed and flayed
them and brought their skins with us to Carthage,” where they
were hung up in the temple of Juno.</p>

<p>This narrative betrays the ancient confusion as to the satyrs’
real nature. They are described as wild men and women, and
it would even seem that the Carthaginians undertook to reason
with their captives; but their captors killed and skinned them,
as they certainly would not have done to creatures they deemed
to be of their species. The terms gorilla and orang-utan both
mean men-of-the-woods. They are borne by large apes, but
when the Malays speak of the orang-utan they mean a savage
and not a simian.</p>

<p>The Hindu term for man-of-the-woods is bunmanus, and here
is a Hindu sketch of him. “The bunmanus is an animal of the
monkey kind. His face has a near resemblance to the human;
he has no tail and walks erect. The skin of his body is black,
and slightly covered with hair.” Then the account proceeds to
enumerate the dialects of the peninsula and includes among
them “the jargon of the bunmanus.” These animals of the
monkey kind are really the dark-skinned, non-Aryan aborigines.</p>

<p>A Portuguese manuscript cited by Tylor tells of an Indian
tribe in Brazil called the Cuatas. “This populous nation,” it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
says, “dwells east of the Juruena, in the neighborhood of the
rivers San Joao and San Thome. It is a very remarkable fact
that the Indians composing it walk naturally like the quadrupeds,
with their hands on the ground; they have the belly, breast,
arms, and legs covered with hair, and are of small stature; they
are fierce, and use their teeth as weapons; they sleep on the
ground, or among the branches of trees; they have no industry,
nor agriculture, and live only on fruits, wild roots, and fish.”
The author of this account seemed not to know that the coata
he was describing was an ape and not a man.</p>

<p>Customs of speech and sometimes motives of self-interest have
shaded the differences between the two species. The belief is
widely held, both in Africa and in South America, that apes
know how to talk, but hold their peace lest they be put to work,
as it seems they were put to work in gathering the fig harvest
in ancient Egypt and perhaps in ceremonial processions as
torch-bearers. On the other hand, sailors, pioneer colonists,
and slave dealers betray a tendency to rate the savages among
whom they are thrown, and whom they may wish to exploit, as
little, if any, above the brutes.</p>

<p>It has become almost a principle of ethnology, wherever a
story of a neighboring race of tailed men is current, to look
for a tribe of aborigines who have been dispossessed by men of
a higher culture. Thus the conqueror asserts his contempt, and
justifies his treatment, of the conquered. The latter may accept
it in good part and admit a monkey descent. The Marawars of
South India trace their lineage back to Rama’s monkeys, and the
Kathkuri avow an ape ancestry. Even the Jaitwas of Rajputana,
although classed as Rajputs, derive, they say, from the monkey-god,
Hanuman, and allege that their princes have still a vestige
of tails. There are tribes in Tibet and in the mountains of the
Malay peninsula whose traditions tell of ape progenitors.</p>

<p>By a sort of poetic justice, savages sometimes tell a like story
about civilized men. Why should these wear so much clothing
if there were not something they wanted to conceal? In the
Land of Lamary, says Maundeville, men and women go all
naked, “and they scorn when they see any strange Folk going
clothed,” hinting that these are not formed as are other men.
Captain Cook was not the only explorer to tell of natives demanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
that the white men strip so that it might be seen if they
were everywhere of the human kind. Buchanan gives this
account in his Indian travels:</p>

<p>“When I passed through among the gardens near houses, I
have observed the women squatting down behind the mud walls,
in order to satisfy their curiosity by viewing a stranger. When
they thought that I observed them, they ran away in a fright.
This does not arise from the rules of caste in Malabar requiring
the Hindu women to be confined, for that is by no means the
case; but in the interior parts of North Malabar the Nairs, being
at enmity with Europeans, have persuaded the women that we
are a kind of hobgoblins who have long tails, in order to conceal
which we wear breeches. The women and children are
therefore afraid of Europeans.”</p>

<p>Stories of man’s descent to the ape match stories of the ape’s
ascent into man. One of these is recited in the Metamorphoses
of Ovid, where for their treachery Jove degrades the Cercopes.
A Moslem legend tells of Solomon passing through the Valley
of Apes, between Jerusalem and Mareb, and finding monkeys
dwelling in the houses, wearing the clothes, and using the speech
of men. The river which flowed by their city had been full of
fish, they said, and these showed themselves freely on the
Sabbath day, trusting to the Jewish fishermen to keep the Commandments.
The temptation proved too strong, and for their
offense of Sabbath-breaking Jehovah turned all the citizens into
apes.</p>

<p>There is a Zulu story of a lazy tribe of negroes who would
not dig the soil. Their chief led them into the wilderness, where
the pick handles which had hung useless at their backs became
tails, and they themselves baboons.</p>

<p>In both hemispheres there are legends of cross-breeding between
the human and the simian species. The Quoyas Morrov,
or wood-man of Angola, which was sent to Frederick Henry,
Prince of Orange, was supposed by his age to have an ape father
or an ape mother. The First People of Central American myth
were manikins who became monkeys, and Count Castelnau repeats
a story by Father Ribeiro, a Carmelite missionary, of a
tribe of tailed Indians in the Amazonian region, whose descent
was from both apes and men. In British Central Africa, says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Sir Harry H. Johnston, the negro women profess to go in terror
of the large male baboons, and it is a fact that these animals will
descend upon parties of unarmed women, but only if they are
carrying well-filled market baskets.</p>

<p>The forests of South America are haunted by two legendary
creatures of related natures, in whom the myths of tailed men
return to their Greek originals. One of these is the salvaje, or
hairy man-of-the-woods, of whom Humboldt first heard among
the cataracts of the Amazon. This creature, the natives, planters,
and missionaries were agreed, carried off women, constructed
huts, and sometimes ate human flesh. For five years, everywhere
the explorer traveled in the Americas, the story followed him,
and he was censured for doubting it. He surmises that the
legend is decked out with features taken from African ape-lore,
but adds that it may be that the man-of-the-woods, if not some
rare ape, is one of the large bears, the footsteps of which resemble
a man’s, and which are believed in every country to
attack women.</p>

<p>“Father Gili,” says Humboldt, “gravely relates the history
of a lady in the Llanos of Venezuela, who so much praised the
gentle character and attentions of the man-of-the-woods. She
is stated to have lived several years with one in great domestic
harmony, and only requested some hunters to take her back because
she and her children (a little hairy, also) were weary of
living far from the church and sacraments.” A Spanish author
wonders, however, if the fable of the man-of-the-woods has not
sprung from the artifice of Indian women who pretended to have
been carried off in default of a better excuse for long absences
from their husbands.</p>

<p>The other legendary creature is the Curupira, or Diable Boiteux.
Among the noises of the Brazilian forest that used to
startle Bates was “a sound like the clang of an iron bar against
a hard, hollow tree, or a piercing cry.” This was never repeated,
and the silence that followed tended to deepen the unpleasant
impression. With the natives it was always the Curupira, the
wild man or spirit of the forest, that made these inexplicable
sounds. “Sometimes,” says Bates, “he is described as a kind of
orang-otang, covered with long, shaggy hair, and living in trees.
At others he is said to have cloven feet and a bright red face. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
has a wife and children, and sometimes comes down to the rocas
to steal the mandioca.”</p>

<p>All accounts agree that the Curupira is not footed like
normal men. He is lame, with one foot larger than the other,
or his feet turn backward so that his trail deceives. He is bald
and dwarfish, with hairy person, huge ears, and blue-green
teeth, and he rides a deer, a rabbit, or a pig. The spirit of the
wood, the guardian of all wild things, he is beneficent or mischievous,
as occasion or mood offers. He insists that game shall
be killed, not maimed, merely, and for a gift of tobacco he will
return lost cattle. Where the forest is darkest, sometimes he
will appear in friendly but treacherous human guise, luring
hunters from the path and at last vanishing in mocking laughter.
When the hunter sees footprints of unequal size on the woodland
trail ahead, if he is well advised he will hasten back, and avoid
the forest for weeks afterward.</p>

<p>Farther north one finds again the tracks of this strange old
man, or of beings like him. The Maidu Indians of California
tell of the Chamlakhu, a bearded ancient with clawlike hands
and feet who lived in trees; running on the ground, his gait was
shambling and his arms fanned the air like wings. The Indians
of Costa Rica tell of a king of the tapirs, a man of stately bearing,
who rebukes hunters that kill out of wantonness. Among
the Indians of Guatemala there are stories of a forest sovereign
and protector of game whom the ladinos call the Sombreron,
from the enormous hat which he wears. Short and sturdy of
figure, he rides his domain astride a deer. He has a rustic
stronghold, and a hunter following a wounded deer once came
upon it. The Sombreron was swinging in a hammock in the
courtyard. He led the hunter to an inclosure in which were
many deer. Pointing out the wounded animal, he said, “Kill it,
but another time shoot better and do not torture my subjects.”</p>

<p>This creature is Arcadian Pan, master of the satyrs, generative
dæmon of the flocks and herds, somehow an emigrant to the
New World. The Filipinos call him the Tig-balang, picture him
with long ears, legs of grasshopper slenderness, and goat hoofs,
and know him for a treacherous jungle guide. The Russians
call him the Lesiy. He guards their forests, misleads wanderers,
removes boundary stones and sign-posts. It is he that makes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
echo. Shouting and whistling in his domain he cannot abide. A
bearded, shaggy, green-eyed old man, he yet entices girls into
his thickets, whence after a long time they may escape, but with
honor forfeited; and he substitutes his stupid changelings for
the children of men. The same or a like figure is Tapio, “the
golden king of the forest” in Finnish magic songs. Wild animals
are his flocks and herds, his queen is the charcoal wife, the
bear is his bastard son, and he lives in Brushwood Town.</p>

<p>Satyr geography covers a good many countries and centuries
and specifically includes at least one civilized race. It was long
the vulgar belief upon the Continent that Englishmen had tails.
This was first the story that the people of one shire told about
another, and its birthplace was Kent. Kentishmen, according to
their neighbors, were tailed, as a punishment for one or the other
of two acts of sacrilege. Their first offense was committed, says
Bailey, when they were still pagans. They abused “Austin the
monk and his associates, by beating them and opprobriously
tying fish tails to their backsides; in revenge of which such appendants
grew to the hind parts of all that generation.” The second
offense was against Thomas À Becket when it was noised
abroad that he was out of favor with Henry II. The inhabitants
of Strood cut off the tail of his horse, and by the will of God,
says Polydore Vergil, “all their offspring were born with tails
like brute animals”; not until their race was extinct did tailed
men pass from Kent.</p>

<p>Pliny numbers among the nations of India “men born with
long hairy tails, and of remarkable swiftness of foot. In Indo-China,
southwest of Yunnan, were the Tailed Pu mentioned in
the <i>Sung Geography</i>. Ma Tuan-Lin allows them tails from
three to four inches long and classes them among anthropophagi
who eat their aged relatives. The Yao, a subtribe of the
Miaotze, have tails like monkeys, their neighbors say. They
live in leaf lodges or caves in the Lipo district south of the
Nanling range, and access to their habitations is by bamboo
ladders. Yet they are skillful weavers and musicians.</p>

</div>

<p>There are numerous reports of tailed tribes in the large
islands of the East. Marco Polo speaks of “a kind of wild men”
in Sumatra, in the kingdom of Lambri, with hairless tails a palm
in length. The <i>Merveilles de L’Inde</i> tells of tailed cannibals on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>the west coast of Sumatra, and Galvano has an account of Sumatrans
with tails like a sheep’s. The fifteenth century <i>History
of the Ming Dynasty</i> pictures the Borneo village of Wu-lung-li-tan
and its tailed citizens. When they see other men approaching
they flee with their hands over their faces. The resemblance of
the name to orang-utan, or “wild men,” will not escape notice.
Colonel Yule tells of a trader who had examined the tails of a
tribe on the northeast coast of Borneo. These appendages were
long and so stiff that the natives had to use perforated seats;
Arab, Malay, and native travelers report having seen them
squatting on these little stools. John Struys, a Dutch traveler
in Formosa, saw there in 1677 a man with a tail “more than a
foot long, covered with red hair, and very like a cow’s.” The
man said the tail was the effect of climate and all the natives on
the southern side of the island had them.</p>

<p>There were two archipelagoes known as the Satyr Islands.
Ptolemy mentions one of them, and Gerini identifies it with the
Northern Anambas lying off the Indo-Chinese mainland. Hsi-tung,
supposed to be a transcript of Syatan, was their name of
old; the resemblance of Syatan to the Greek Satyron may have
led Levantine sailors to make this jest at the expense of ill-favored
little people living then in the Anamba group. To reach
the other archipelago one must steer through the Pillars of
Hercules in company with a Carian sailor of the second century.
Him Pausanias asked what he knew about the satyrs. The
Carian replied that in a voyage to Italy he was driven from his
course to a distant sea whither people no longer sail. Here were
many islands which the crew did not care to touch, and these
they called the Satyr Islands. Their inhabitants were red-haired
and had tails not much smaller than a horse’s.</p>

<p>Many African tribes wore animal tails for ornament, and explorers
were sometimes misled by the custom. The Duir of the
northeast attached two antelope tails to their girdles. The Wa-Kavorondo,
east of the Nyanza, go naked or wear only a waist-cloth,
and the women attach to it a tail of bark. In the same
quarter of Africa the Bongo women, with their large hips and
lubricious gait, have had a share in propagating fable, for they,
too, ornament themselves with tails; and as they stride along they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
swing these about in conscious emulation of the flocks and herds.
Schweinfurth likens them to “dancing baboons.”</p>

<p>Other African satyr stories do not yield their secret so easily.
The Ba-Kwambas of the northwest, report said, had tails which
they inserted in holes in the ground when they sat down. In his
<i>Travels and Adventures</i> (1861) Doctor Wolf asserted that in
Abyssinia were men and women “with tails like dogs and
horses,” some of these so large that they were able to knock
down a horse with them. About the Niam-Niams, a cannibal
people with filed teeth that live in French Equatorial Africa,
legends have multiplied, and these Baring Gould has assembled.</p>

<p>Horneman was the first to describe them as tailed anthropophagi.
In 1849 M. Descouret reported that this was the common
belief among the Arabs. In 1851 M. de Castelnau told of a
Houssa expedition in which a band of Niam-Niams was slaughtered
to a man. All, including the women, had hairless tails
about fifteen inches long. These people were otherwise a handsome
race, of a deep black, using clubs and javelins in war, and
in peace cultivating rice, maize, and other grains. An Abyssinian
priest, seemingly speaking of the same tribe, told M. d’Abbadie
in 1852 that only the men had tails, and these were covered
with hair and the length of a palm. Doctor Hubsch, physician
to the hospitals of Constantinople, examined in 1852 a
tailed negress of the Niam-Niams who was offered for sale in
the slave market. She was black as ebony, with frizzled hair,
bloodshot eyes, large white teeth, and a smooth, hairless, pointed
tail two inches long. Her clothes fidgeted her, she ate meat raw,
and was an avowed cannibal. The slave dealer said all her
tribe was as herself.</p>

<p>In Cuba Columbus heard of a province called Mangou, lying
farther west, and it sounded like Mangi, the rich maritime province
of the Grand Khan. Its inhabitants had tails, and wore garments
to conceal them. Columbus recalled the Maundeville
story, related above, of the scorn of certain naked Asiatics for
clothing, and their belief that garments hid bodily defects. So
he pressed onward in the thought that Mangi and the robed
peoples of Tartary lay just below the horizon.</p>

<p>Despite witness from Asia, Africa, and the eastern and western
Indies, there are no tailed races of men. But there have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
tailed individuals. Hottentot women come nearest meeting the
requirements of legend. Without a tail, they yet have a development
of the posteriors that amounts to a natural shelf, on which,
as on a pillion, their infants may ride. The mandril and certain
other monkeys living in the same latitudes show a like enlargement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c11">Chapter XI. The Pygmies</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> was left to the pygmy to revenge all of the creatures of
fable upon incredulous mankind. He was doubted, yet he is. Not
until some fifty years ago would the learned doubters admit that
Homer and Herodotus were right, and themselves wrong. Now
it is in the books that half a hundred groups of pygmies are
living on the earth, to say nothing of others that have become
extinct. Every race has had such groups, and every continent
has known their tread.</p>

<p>There is palliation for ancient and modern doubts as to these
dwarfish nations. The pygmies of reality are not so small as
the pygmies of tradition. Their name is from the Greek word
for fist, or the distance between the elbow joint and the knuckles
of the average man—a little more than thirteen inches. The
ancient geographers, however, allowed the smallest pygmies at
least double that stature. There were two species of little men—the
one averaging three spans, or two feet three inches high,
the other averaging five spans, or three feet nine inches. These
measurements recur again and again for fifteen centuries in the
writings of the east and west.</p>

<p>No race has a mean stature as short even as the pygmies of
five spans, but among the dwarf tribes there are many women
who do not greatly exceed it; and there are women, not so small
according to the standards of their brothers as to be accounted
deformed, who do not equal it. Stanley saw among the Akkas
of the West African Rain Forest a grown girl of seventeen who
was half an inch short of three feet.</p>

<p>Poetic license of the old time took liberties with the estimates
of geographers, but these liberties were understood as such.
The dwarf nation on the Upper Nile that was reputed to war with
the cranes used the ax, it was said, to cut down ears of wheat.
When Hercules passed through their country they set up ladders
to climb to the rim of his goblet for a drink. In his slumber two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
armies swooped down upon his right hand and two on his left;
but, awaking, the hero laughingly gathered them all in his lion
skin.</p>

<p>The myth of their warfare with the cranes became a theme
of literature and art, but cast doubt over the whole pygmy tradition.
It first appears in Homer. The <i>Iliad</i> likens the shouts
of the onrushing Trojans to the cries of cranes as they fly southward
“with noise and order through the sky,” bringing “wounds
and death to pygmy nations.” Megasthenes elaborates the
theme. It is the three-span pygmies, he says, that war upon the
cranes, as well as on the partridges, which are as large as geese.
The small folk collect and destroy the eggs of the cranes, which
breed in India and nowhere else. Pliny adds that every spring
the little men go in a body to the seashore, astride of rams and
goats, and there destroy the eggs and young of the birds; “otherwise,
it would be impossible for them to withstand the increasing
multitude of the cranes.” The shore booths which they occupy
they build of mud mixed with feathers and egg shells.</p>

<p>So the story moves from Africa to India, and towards modern
times. Maundeville declares that in the Land of Pygmies, which
he seems to place to the west of, and tributary to, China, the
inhabitants “have oftentimes war with the Birds of that Country
that they take and eat.” There is even a reference to this warfare
in the writing (1563) of a traveler in Greenland. There
Dithmar Blefkens of Hamburg met a blind monk who said that
the pygmies represented the most perfect shape of man, but
were “hairy to the uttermost Joynts of the Fingers,” had no
proper speech, and were “unreasonable Creatures that live in
Perpetual Darkness.”</p>

<p>India appears to be the home of the tradition that the dwarfish
peoples warred with the cranes. Just a hint of its origin is afforded
by Ctesias. The “swarthy men called Pygmies,” he said,
“hunt hares and foxes not with dogs, but with ravens and kites
and crows and vultures.” Falconry is known to have been practiced
in India as early as B.C. 600 and may be a thousand years
older there. From a people’s using birds of prey in hunting to
themselves fighting against birds of prey is a step of inference
easy to take.</p>

<p>There is, however, a more direct explanation. According to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
a tradition of the Indians, the Garuda, the bird of Vishnu, was
hostile to the people of the Kirata, and the name of this people
means “dwarfish.” While the sacred bird as pictured by the
poets does not look like the crane, or any other known species,
it may be near enough to account for the legend.</p>

<p>Herodotus was the first to give the pygmy tradition a historical
quality. He heard of the little people while he was collecting
materials for his books in Africa. His informants were natives
of Cyrene who had been to the shrine of Ammon and talked with
Etearchus the Ammonian king. The latter tells the story of the
adventure of the five Nasamonian youths, which he had received
from their Libyan countrymen and which Herodotus, therefore
transcribes at third hand:</p>

<p>“The Nasamonians said there had grown up among them some
wild young men, the sons of certain chiefs, who, when they
came to man’s estate, indulged in all manner of extravagances,
and among other things drew lots for five of their number to
go and explore the desert parts of Libya, and try if they could
not penetrate further than any had done previously. The young
men, therefore, dispatched on this errand by their comrades
with a plentiful supply of water and provision, traveled at first
through the inhabited region, passing which they came to the
wild beast tract, whence they finally entered upon the desert,
which they proceeded to cross from east to west. After journeying
for many days over a wide extent of sand, they came at
last to a plain where they observed trees growing; approaching
them, and seeing fruit on them, they proceeded to gather it.</p>

<p>“While they were thus engaged there came upon them some
dwarfish men, under the middle height, who seized them and
carried them off. The Nasamonians could not understand a
word of their language, nor had they any acquaintance with the
language of the Nasamonians. They were led across extensive
marshes, and finally came to a town where all the men were of
the height of their conductors, and black complexioned. A
great river flowed by the town, running from west to east, and
containing crocodiles.</p>

<p>“Here let me dismiss Etearchus, the Ammonian, and his story,
only adding that he declared that the Nasamonians got safely
back to their country and that the men whose city they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
reached were a nation of sorcerers. With respect to the river
which ran by their town, Etearchus conjectured it to be the Nile,
and reason favors that view.”</p>

<p>Thus ends one of the most valuable records which have come
down from ancient times. The river referred to is now believed
to be the Niger, or perhaps an affluent of Lake Tchad. Herodotus
has another story of a dwarfish people found in the west
when Sataspes, the Carthaginian, undertook to sail around Libya.</p>

<p>Although Strabo doubted the existence of pygmy races, yet
his keen mind brought him within reach of the truth. He finds
in the wretched mode of life of the people he called the Ethiopians,
an explanation of the reports of their dwarfish stature.
They were naked and wandered from place to place, and their
sheep, goats, oxen, and dogs were undersized like themselves.
“It was perhaps from the diminutive size of these people,” he
concludes, “that the story of the pygmies originated, whom no
person worthy of credit has asserted that he himself has seen.”
The Greek geographer seems to have had reliable information as
to a fact that on its face is as hard to believe as the legends he
discredits—that there was dwarfish live stock as well as a dwarfish
people. Sir Samuel Baker found that the cows and ewes of
the Bari, a tribe living in the same district with the forest pygmies,
“have dimensions truly liliputian.”</p>

<p>Aristotle speaks with authority of the pygmies of Africa.
“The storks,” he said, “pass from the plains of Scythia to the
marsh of upper Egypt, toward the sources of the Nile. This is
the district which the pygmies inhabit, whose existence is not a
fable. There is really, as men say, a species of men of little
stature, and their horses are little also. They pass their life in
caverns.” Pliny speaks of the pygmies as dwelling in Thrace
near the Black Sea, in the Carian district of Asia Minor, in
India under the shadow of the Himalayas, and at the sources
of the Nile. There is a valuable fact behind this apparently
confused geography: the Roman was right in assuming there
were several such races.</p>

<p>The pygmy races of Asia and Indonesia are cited in classic,
Arabic, and Chinese geography, and in mediæval travel. “In
the middle of India,” Ctesias says, “are found the swarthy men
called pygmies, who speak the same language as the other Indians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
They are very diminutive, the tallest but two cubits
high, the majority only one and one-half. They let their hair
grow very long—down to their knees and even lower. They
have the largest beards anywhere to be seen, and when these
have grown sufficiently long and copious, they no longer wear
clothing, but let the hair of the head fall down their backs
far below the knee, while in front are their beards trailing
down to their very feet. When their hair has thus thickly enveloped
their whole body they bind it round them with a zone
and so make it serve for a garment. They are snub-nosed and
otherwise ill-favored. Their sheep are of the size of our lambs,
and their oxen and asses rather smaller than our rams. Three
thousand men attend the king of the Indians on account of their
great skill in archery. They are eminently just and have the
same laws as the other Indians.”</p>

<p>This may be a description of the Kiratas, whose district is
east of Bengal in the Himalaya foothills.</p>

<p>There were vague reports in the classic world of other pygmy
peoples far to the southeast in Asia. The Chinese records make
these more definite. The <i>Hill and Sea Classic</i> describes the
Chiau Yau, a tribe of cap-wearing pygmies three cubits (3 feet
3 inches) high whose country was east of the country of the
Three-headed Men. This is perhaps the country now inhabited
by the Yau tribes, who are short of stature and may be this
long-sought-for pygmy race. Individuals of the Chiau Yau
tribe, “diminutive black slaves,” were sent to the Chinese court
from the coasts of Indo-China in the reign of Ming Tu (A.D. 58-76).
There was also a pygmy people whom the Annamese
called the Phong. They were only two cubits, or twenty-six
inches, high, and although they were cave dwellers a fragrant
perfume emanated from their skins. As hunters they paid their
dues to the state in camphor, rhinoceros horns, and elephant
tusks. Both of these races Gerini locates in “the mysterious
country of the pygmies” in French Indo-China, between the
Mekong and the Black rivers, under the twenty-first parallel of
north latitude. North of this district on the Red River dwell the
dark, dwarfish Pu-lu tribes which seem to be the remnants of a
once widely spread pygmy race. The Santom aborigines of
Yun-nan and Laos are also of inferior stature, with flat faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
and black skins. In China itself ancient writings speak of the
black dwarfs of Shantung province as early as the twenty-third
century B.C.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first record of the Aetas, or Philippine negritos,
appears in Chao Fu-Kua, a Chinese author of the early thirteenth
century, who told of a tribe of small black men with frizzly hair,
round yellow eyes, and teeth that showed through their lips, who
lived in remote valleys of the archipelago. A Chinese work on
novelties, published in 1636, has several passages on the black
dwarfs of Cochin-China. Anywhere from Annam to Siam, it
says, “there are pygmies whose stature is not over three feet
seven inches, who are regarded as of animal origin, who sell
themselves for longer or shorter periods to dealers in aloes.
When engaged they are provisioned, supplied with hatchets and
saws, and sent into the mountains. These dwarfs are very submissive
and servile.”</p>

<p>Ibn Khordadbeh and Idrisi tell of the Rami, a pygmy race of
Sumatra, who go naked, find shelter in thickets, avoid intercourse
with other people, and use a hissing speech. They are
swift runners and adept tree climbers. They have red frizzly hair
and a stature of but three feet. Curled hair of this color had
been ascribed from the seventh century A.D. to the clawed
negrito savages on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, and a
traveler of the last generation reports hairy dwarfs on the southwest
coast of Sumatra. Dunashki (about A.D. 1300) has this
note: “When ships approach Volcano Island at the beginning of
a squall, tiny black dwarfs, five spans (nearly four feet) or less
in stature, resembling negroes, appear and climb aboard, without
harming anyone.” All three of these travel notes may be
reflected in the incident in the third voyage of Sindbad, when his
ship, driven by a storm amid strange islands, is boarded by “an
innumerable multitude of frightful savages about two feet high,
covered all over with red hair,” who compel the crew to follow
them to the palace of a giant cannibal.</p>

<p>Accounts of several other travelers bring the pygmy tradition
down to the era of modern disbelief. Odoric, the fourteenth-century
missionary monk, reports that the Yangste Kiang waters
the Country of the Pygmies, whom he describes as an innumerable
folk, three spans high, and foremost of all cotton workers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Their city of Chatan is one of the fairest of places. Æthicus of
Istria declares that he sailed northwest from Ceylon and passed,
among other islands in the Northern Sea, Bridinno, the land of
dwarfs. Marco Polo tells how pygmies were fabricated from
monkeys in Sumatra and sold to curio collectors.</p>

<p>Maundeville makes the pygmies subject to “the great Chan.”
“The River Dalay,” he says, “goeth through the land of Pygmies,
where that the Folk be of little Stature, and be but three Span
long, and they be right fair and gentle. And they marry them
when they be half a Year of Age and get Children. And they
live not but six Year or seven at the most; and he that liveth
eight Year, Men hold him there right passing old. These Men
be workers of Gold, Silver, Cotton, Silk and of all such Things,
the best of any other that be in the World.” Men of larger size
work their lands and mines for them.</p>

<p>In another passage Sir John populates an isle with “Little
Folk,” who have no mouths and only an adder speech. Pigafetta,
who went with the Magellan expedition around the world
and wrote its story, reports two races of dwarfs in the Philippines,
one with gigantic ears. The latter were shaven, naked,
shrill-voiced troglodytes, whose food was the sago tree.</p>

<p>Ludovico Varthema, an Italian Mohammedan, a contemporary
of Columbus and a wide-ranging traveler, tells an incident of his
pilgrimage to Mecca, which may or may not shed light on the
moot question of the Middle Ages and since, as to what became
of the lost Ten Tribes. There was a mountain in the Hedjaz, he
said, inhabited by pygmy Jews, color black, who skipped from
crag to crag like goats—he watched them from a distance—and
when they caught a Moslem skinned him alive.</p>

<p>In Madagascar in 1770 the French naturalist Commerson,
who accompanied Bougainville in his voyage around the world,
found evidences of a pygmy tribe with an average stature of
three and a half feet, all traces of which vanished in the following
century. His report was corroborated by Count de Modave,
governor of Fort Dauphin. The men of this tribe wore long
beards and were workers in iron and steel, of which they made
lances and assagais. They were brave pacifists. When from
their mountain homes they saw a formidable force approaching
on the plains below, they drove down such cattle as they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
spare to the entrances of their defiles to purchase immunity
from invasion. If, however, the enemy entered these defiles,
the little folk savagely attacked them.</p>

<p>Near to the country of the warrior women in South America,
said the Spaniards, was pygmy land. Peru has traditions of a
race not over two cubits high. California Indians tell of a witch-like
little people in the redwood forest. The Arapahoes tell of
dark-skinned, pot-bellied, cannibal dwarfs who were only three
feet high but strongly made, and skillful trackers. They could
carry buffaloes on their backs, so the Crows said of the small
folk that once roved Montana. In the Gila Canyon in New
Mexico there have been exhumed the mummies of a true pygmy
people, some of them scarcely three feet long, with cerements of
woven cloth, sandals of yucca fiber and ornaments of hummingbird
feathers; legend speaks of thievish dwarfs who lived in
underground houses and sometimes came to the cities for supplies.
D’Orbigny described, in 1831, the so-called Chiquitos, or
Little Folk, who inhabit the heights on the divide between the
Mamore and Paraguay rivers. The men he measured averaged
only four feet ten inches, which brings them within strict pygmy
requirements—not over four feet eleven inches. They are a
broad-shouldered, robust Indian people, hospitable, sociable,
musical. D’Orbigny estimated their number at about twenty
thousand. No recent traces have been found of the Ayamanes
whom Friedemann met in the northern Andes regions and who,
he said, were no more than “five empans,” or three feet four
inches, high.</p>

<p>There is a Chinese legend that in the remote northern mountains
of the old empire there has lived for seventeen centuries
a race of hairy dwarfs. Inscriptions on the Great Wall are said
to recite that whenever one of the millions of laborers who were
building it was found to have made a mistake in his work, he
was imbedded alive in the wall at the place of his error.
About A.D. 210, the story continues, a body of workmen rebelled
at the custom, and with their families fled to distant
forests where their descendants still live. The hardships of their
journey and their rude surroundings brought these people down
to the pygmy level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>It is asserted that there is a race of dwarfs in Morocco in
the Atlas Mountains whose existence the Moors have kept secret
for three thousand years because they are regarded as holy men,
and great saints who bring good luck to towns. “Our Blessed
Lord,” the people call a dwarf. “It is a sin to speak about them
to you,” one Moor said to a traveler. The Moorish silence is
declared to be the remnant of a superstition older than the
Mohammedan religion.</p>

<p>These pygmy stories, of perhaps twenty-seven centuries so
far as the record goes, of at least double that period if unwritten
tradition be included, have been brought together here in order
to assess the scientific reaction to them. Some of them on their
face are completely fabulous, some have an admixture of truth,
some are good enough history. To all except the very latest
of them the scientific reaction was unfavorable until a deluge
of facts made this attitude impossible.</p>

<p>Strabo among the ancients was in his rights when he complained
that nobody had seen any pygmies, but his facts were
incomplete, for long before his day civilized peoples had seen
them. Browne summarizes in his stiff but elegant English the
unbelief of the scholars of the Renaissance: “Julius Scaliger, a
diligent enquirer, accounts thereof, but as a poetical fiction.
Ulysses Aldrovandus, a most exact geographer, in an express
discourse hereon, concludes the story fabulous and a poetical
account of Homer. Albertus Magnus, a man ofttimes too
credulous, herein was more than dubious; for he affirmeth if any
such dwarfs were ever extant, they were surely some kind
of apes; which is a conceit allowed by Cardan and not esteemed
improbable by many others.” “There is as much reality,” concludes
Browne, “in the pygmies of Paracelsus, that is, his non-adamical
men, or middle natures betwixt men and spirits.”</p>

<p>Two towering names in natural history, Buffon and Cuvier,
are ranged against the pygmy tradition. Here is Buffon’s conclusion:
“Deceived by some optical illusion, the ancient historians
gravely mention whole nations of pygmies as existing in
remote quarters of the world. The more accurate observation
of the moderns, however, convinces us that these accounts are
entirely fabulous. The existence, therefore, of a pygmy race of
mankind, being founded in error or in fable, we can expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
to find men of diminutive stature only by accident, among men
of the ordinary size.”</p>

<p>Buffon’s explanation of the fable that the pygmies war with
the cranes is so plausible that men would accept it, as his own
generation did, if they did not know that these little folk are
human and not simian. Even so, there may be truth in the
theory advanced. “One knows,” says Buffon, “that the monkeys,
which go in large bands in Africa and India, carry on
continual warfare against birds; they seek to surprise their
nests, and without ceasing prepare ambushes for them. The
storks defend themselves vigorously. But the monkeys, anxious
to carry off the eggs and the young birds, return constantly, and
in bands, to the combat; and as by their tricks, their feints and
movements they seem to imitate human actions, they would
appear to ignorant people to be a band of little men. Behold
the origin and the history of these fables!”</p>

<p>Roulin was equally ingenious in his explanation of the pygmy
populations and their campaigns against the birds. He noted
the squat frames of the Lapps and Eskimos who dwell within,
or not far from, the Arctic Circle. The pygmies, he decided,
were a circumpolar population. Homer placed their home and
their battles at the southern end of the crane path; Roulin placed
them at the northern terminus, in that Scythia of misty boundaries
one of which was supposed to be the boreal ocean. Pliny had
told that every year the pygmies rode down to the seashore to
destroy the eggs and young of the cranes. Very well, here was
the story explained, for every year the Lapps and Eskimos come
down to the sea and return to the interior, and these people
partly subsist on the eggs of aquatic birds.</p>

<p>Cuvier is reproachful of Pliny. “I am not surprised,” he
says, “at finding the pygmies in the works of Homer; but to
find them in Pliny I am surprised indeed.” The great French
naturalist has contributed more, perhaps, than any other man to
find the basis of truth or the source of error in classic fables.
His explanation of the pygmy legend, like that of Buffon, is
more convincing almost than truth itself, but its teaching is
error. He finds the source of a fable in a flattering convention
of ancient sculpture: “The custom of exhibiting in the same
sculpture, in bas-relief, men of very different heights—of making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
kings and conquerors gigantic while their subjects and
vassals are represented as only one-fourth or one-fifth of their
size—must have given rise to the fable of the pygmies.”</p>

<p>Cuvier died in 1832. Chambers’ <i>Journal</i> in 1844 voiced with
less reserve the unbelief of that period. In a scoffing article it
declares that “the world has long been haunted with the idea that
somewhere in Africa there is a nation of Tom Thumbs”; but
“the grand difficulty about the African nation of dwarfs is the
fact that not a single specimen has been seen either in Abyssinia
or Egypt.” “The pygmy dream, one of the last lingering superstitions
of travel, has been puffed away,” confidently asserts this
periodical. These so-called pygmies were monkeys, not men.</p>

<p>In 1863 Paul du Chaillu explored the coast lands of West
Africa and in 1871 published the results in <i>The Country of the
Dwarfs</i>. The scientific skepticism of the ages delivered its last
stroke in the attacks that met this book, for already, although the
world did not know it, Schweinfurth, farther east in the equatorial
region, had reviewed an entire pygmy army. The <i>London
Graphic</i> wonders whether or not “Mr. du Chaillu means us to
accept the book as a bona-fide narrative of what he has himself
seen.” Thus cautiously this periodical registers its doubts:
“The first part of the book reads very much like other descriptions
of African exploration; but further on Mr. du Chaillu
represents himself as having arrived at the country of the
dwarfs, whom he considers to be identical with the supposed
fabulous pygmies. This strange race, who average only from
four feet to four feet seven inches high, live a perfectly wild
life in the forests of equatorial Africa, feeding on snakes, rats,
mice, and berries. They go entirely naked, and inhabit huts
made by bending branches of trees in the shape of a bow. The
height of the huts is just enough to keep the head of a man from
touching the roof when he is seated. These dwarfs are very shy
of being seen and hold no communion with the negro tribes
about them, by whom they are called Obongos. Truly we have
here a strange tale.”</p>

<p>Truly, there are not only lost arts, but lost records, forgotten
histories. Forty-four centuries before du Chaillu was scoffed
at for a true tale, an authentic pygmy testimony was set down
in a letter which a king of Egypt wrote to a vassal chief, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>which is still in existence. The world believed in pygmies then
because sometimes it saw them; and their descendants still hunt
the elephant in the forests of equatorial Africa.</p>

<p class="caption">“THE SWARTHY MEN CALLED PYGMIES”</p>
</div>

<p>To the Egyptians of that time the country beyond the Second
Cataract of the Nile was the Land of Ghosts, whence the negroes
brought to the markets of Assuan strange stories of shadowy folk
who dwelt there. Into this land a prince of Elephantine named
Herkhuf marched with a little force. An account of his journey
has been written by Arthur E. P. Weigall, of the Department of
Antiquities of Egypt.</p>

<p>In the country which Herkhuf penetrated he found pygmies
dwelling, and one he secured. He sent word back to the boy
Pharaoh, Pepy II, and had from him a letter believed to be the
earliest example of a private communication. Yet life still
throbs through its lines and the colors glow in the picture of
an excited royal lad awaiting the coming of this wonder of the
south, directing that his meals shall be ample, that his slumbers
shall be guarded, and that on taking ship at Memphis there
shall be men to see he does not fall into the water. The Pharaoh’s
letter follows:</p>

<p>“You say in your letter that you have brought a dancing
pygmy of the god from the Land of Ghosts, like the pygmy which
the Treasurer Baurded brought from the Land of Pount in the
time of Asesa. You say to my majesty, ‘Never before has one
like him been brought by anyone who has visited Aam.’ Come
northward, therefore, to the court immediately, and bring this
pygmy with you, which you must bring living, prosperous, and
healthy, from the Land of Ghosts, to dance for the King and to
rejoice and gladden the heart of the King. When he goes down
with you into the vessel, appoint trustworthy people to be beside
him at either side of the vessel: take care that he does not fall
into the water. When he sleeps at night, appoint trustworthy
people who shall sleep beside him in his cabin; and make an
inspection ten times each night. My majesty desires to see
this pygmy more than the gifts of Sinai and of Pount. If you
arrive at court, the pygmy being with you, alive, prosperous, and
healthy, my majesty will do for you a greater thing than that
which was done for the Treasurer Baurded in the time of Asesa,
according to the heart’s desire of my majesty to see this pygmy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Orders have been sent to the chief of the New Towns to arrange
that food shall be taken from every store-city and every temple
(on the road) without stinting.”</p>

<p>A Nubian Highway, so Weigall calls the ancient road down
which the dancing pygmy came to civilization about B.C. 2500.
In A. D. 1878 a little farther south, Stanley followed what he
calls a Pygmy Highway, “along which quite a tribe must have
passed. It was lined with amoma fruit skins, and shells of nuts,
and the crimson rinds of phrynia berries. Our elephant and
game track had brought us across another track leading easterly
from Andari, and both joined presently, developing to a highway
much patronized by the pygmy tribes. We could tell where they
had stopped to light their pipes, and to crack nuts, and trap
game, and halted to gossip. The twigs were broken three feet
from the ground, showing that they were snapped by dwarfs.
Where it was a little muddy the path showed high, delicate
insteps, proving their ancient ancestry and aristocratic descent,
and small feet not larger than those of young English misses
of eight years old.” Later Stanley met individuals of this
tribe.</p>

<p>These were the Akkas, or Mambuti, the same pygmy tribe, it
would appear, whose sculptured reliefs on monuments of Egypt
going back as far as B.C. 3366 were dwarfed, so Cuvier had
thought, merely to make a conqueror seem larger than life and
indicate their own inferior estate. When a regiment of several
hundred of these little warriors marched behind Moummeri in
1870 to do homage to Munza, the East African negro monarch,
the pygmy tradition marched with them out of the mists of fable
across the border of geographical knowledge. For Schweinfurth,
a European explorer, was there to behold these “grasshopper
warriors,” as he called them.</p>

<p>The revolution in scientific opinion since that day appears in
the statement that the ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>
prints one paragraph about the pygmies, nearly all of which
is an exposition of myths and a statement of doubts, while the
eleventh edition prints two full pages of ascertained facts.</p>

<p>Although science always balked at the name of pygmy and
refused as long as it could to admit that the African forests
concealed a race of tiny men, yet the world had long known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
something of the little peoples. The Spaniards rightly reported
that pygmy Indians had lived in Peru, and they found negritos
in the Philippines. Although Arab traders gave the Andamans
a wide berth because, as they believed, these islands contained
cannibals and no cocoanuts, yet they knew even before the
Middle Ages that a dwarfish people dwelt there. The Dutch
found the Bushmen when they settled South Africa, and hunted
them for sport as if they were jackals; they found also the still
smaller Vaalpens, or “dusty-bellies.” The Lapps of Russia
and Scandinavia were known to mediæval travelers, who were
terrified by their diminutive stature and witch repute. These
mongoloid people, whose mean stature is only five feet, and
their kinsmen, the Eskimos, who are a little taller, are, however,
not classified among the true pygmies, a term which an arbitrary
convention restricts to Little Black Men.</p>

<p>The pygmies of Asia and Oceania are called negritos, the
pygmies of equatorial Africa negrillos. They vary by tribes in
average height from four feet eight inches to five feet two inches,
with the women smaller and many individuals only a little above
four feet. A full-grown Akka adult, says Stanley, may weigh
ninety pounds. Another explorer estimated the average weight
of six of these adults at seventy-seven pounds and found that
two of them weighed but fifty-three pounds apiece.</p>

<p>Wherever seen, the tribes of little people have certain things
in common beside their stature. One of these is their discontinuous
distribution. They do not adjoin each other in a continuous
zone of population as the taller races do, but are dotted
here and there across the earth like islands in a sea of alien
populations. Always they occupy the less desirable districts.
The Spaniards called the Philippine pygmies Negritos del
Monte, for they had retired before the Malays to the mountain
gorges. The Lapps rove the tundras of northern Europe. The
Bushmen dwell in the deserts of South Africa. The Akkas inhabit
the steaming forests of equatorial Africa, in parallels of
latitude deadly to the white man. The Batwas live on volcanic
uplands in the Tanganyika country. In the Malay Peninsula
and New Guinea, one seeks in vain for littoral-dwelling
negritos; they have been driven inland and to the mountain
recesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Almost everywhere the little people somewhat resemble in
feature the races that surround them. This is due to unions,
temporary or otherwise, between the pygmy women and the
men of the neighbor tribes, by which various streams of strange
blood have poured into the veins of the lesser stock. Among
the Lapps of earlier generations it almost seemed as if it were
conscious tribal policy to promote a taller stature by encouraging
women and girls to form irregular connections with men of
other European races. There is Bushman blood in the Hottentots,
or Hottentot blood in the Bushmen. In the so-called
Bastards of the Kalahari Desert—a term whereof the wearers
are proud because it concedes to them a Caucasian strain—the
blood of the Bushmen meets the blood of the Boers in the halfway
house of the Hottentot.</p>

<p>Herbert Long, who spent six years in Central Africa with
an expedition from the American Museum of Natural History,
notes in its <i>Journal</i> for 1919 the fact that the pygmy men he
saw were often much taller than their mates, and gives a reason,
that may explain the same phenomenon in related tribes.
Comely pygmy girls enter the harems of the chiefs of the tall
negro tribes. Their half-breed sons are sent back to their own
people. Since women are valuable chattels, the daughters are
retained by the father’s tribe. The custom increases pygmy
prestige; but the little men must not wed the women of their
tall friends.</p>

<p>The small black folk of the forest have thus won a right to
the marked regional resemblance they bear to the larger black
folk of the yam and breadfruit clearings, whom they serve as
scouts against the approach of an enemy and as allies in forest
warfare. “In western Africa, as in the Philippines and in the
two Gangetic peninsulas,” asserts Quatrefages, “the pygmies
have played an ethnological rôle, at times important, in crossing
with superior races and in giving birth to half-breed populations.”
The Pandavas, or heroes of the oldest Indian times,
set the example of these unions with lower races.</p>

<p>The Dravidians of southern India, Quatrefages declares, occupy
the territory formerly populated by the negritos—and
carry their blood. He also thinks that the blood of these little
blacks shows itself in the skin and stature of natives in parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of Japan. Relics of a pygmy race are supposed to exist in
Sicily and Sardinia, “along the highroad between Pleistocene
Africa and Europe”; fifteen per cent of the men of South Italy
and Sardinia are rejected for military service because less than
sixty-one and one half inches high. South of Salamanca in western
Spain, the valley called Las Jurdes is peopled by men and
women said to be little more than three feet high, whose shrunken
stature is attributed to unwholesome surroundings.</p>

<p>No true pygmy race has developed a pronounced nose bridge,
and only the lozenge-faced Bushmen have salient chins. Among
nearly all of the tribes there is a deficiency in the fatty tissues
which affect the skin, so that, even before old age comes, they
present a wrinkled appearance as if the skin fitted too loosely.
This is true even of the Lapps. The countenances of these
northern dwarfs are mongoloid, but without the slanting eyes of
the Chinese and Tartars, and their heads are the roundest of
any race of men. The negrito and negrillo tribes have rounder
heads than the tall negroes. The bodies of many of the little
people in Central Africa and New Guinea are covered with a
downy growth. Pygmy complexions show olive in the Lapps,
light yellow in the Bushmen, yellow brown in the Indonesians,
dark brown in the negritos of the Andamans and Philippines,
and among the Akkas, as Schweinfurth puts it, the color of
coffee slightly roasted.</p>

<p>Small hands and in some cases small feet characterize these
tribes, and grown girls of the Bushmen show, under measurement,
feet but little more than four inches long. Their bodies
are long in proportion to their legs, and the legs are slim.
The mid-point of the body is above the navel instead of below,
as it is in the tall races. The pygmies of Africa are pot-bellied;
this is due to diet, and is corrected by regular and wholesome
food.</p>

<p>In other respects the pygmies differ from the rest of mankind
chiefly in what they lack. Save in the case of the Semangs
of the Malay Peninsula they may have no separate language;
and they use always the speech of their taller neighbors. There
is no pygmy state, or king, and often no tribal organization;
even among the Lapps there was a nomad tribe called the “twice
and thrice tributary Lapps,” because its members paid tribute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
to two, sometimes to three states—Russia, Denmark, and Sweden.
The Andaman negritos and the Akkas of the West African
Rain Forest are the only races that never devised a means of
making fire, though both know its use. The Andamanese are also
the only people that never made a musical instrument and
the only people that never domesticated a food animal or cultivated
a plant.</p>

<p>One or two things, however, may be said for the culture of
the little folk. There are no pygmy cannibals. Although the
Bushman houses, mere mats suspended on stakes, are the most
primitive known, yet these are the most skilled artists in South
Africa, and some of their figures suggest that they may have
known hieroglyphic writing. All the little peoples treat their
women kindly, and reverence gray hairs. The Andamanese
are monogamous and believe in an omniscient deity. On the
other hand, the highest religious concept among the polygamous
Akkas is of a pygmy devil. The Bushmen live in a state approaching
sexual promiscuity; it used to be the custom, when
a man wished a temporary mate, to kidnap a small child, and
the mother would follow the child into his home. The Andamanese
have the peculiar custom of manifesting joy by weeping,
and it is said the Veddahs never laugh.</p>

<p>No certain statements may be made as to the aggregate numbers
of the dwarf nations. There are about 50,000 Bushmen,
27,000 Lapps, 20,000 Aetas, 2,000 Mincoupies, 2,000 Veddahs.
It may be that the equatorial pygmies are half as numerous as
the Aetas. Everywhere the number of these people is diminishing.</p>

<p>As to their origin and the cause of their shrunken stature,
there is no agreement among ethnologists. The small blacks
may have come into existence in South India and spread thence
east and west, peopling Melanesia and Africa. Once they
formed a belt of population clear across equatorial Africa. On
the evidences of crania which he examined, Professor Kollman
believes that, about b.c. 5000, they dwelt as far down the Nile
Valley as the Thebaid. The Oriental branch of the race, pure or
mixed, extends, says Quatrefages, from the extreme southeast
of New Guinea to the archipelago of the Andamans and from
the Sunda Islands to Japan, and on the Asiatic continent from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Annam and the peninsula of Malacca to the western Ghauts, and
from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas. This grandiose geography
is challenged by later scholarship.</p>

<p>Yet over all these wide spaces, and over the Dark Continent,
pygmies may have been the first settlers. Once it was surmised
that the tall negritoes sprang from them; but this is a moot
point. To accept it would be to assert that short stature is a
primitive trait, and that all the tall races are in this respect
abnormal. British anthropologists hold that the Bushmen are
a distinct people, but that the Congo pygmies, though of livelier
intelligence than the tall blacks, are yet special groups of the
Nilotic or Bantu negroes, arrested or degenerated by the inhospitable
forest. Their diminished stature, Stanley urges, is
the result of “three thousand years of isolation, intermarriage,
and a precarious diet of fungi, wild fruit, lean fibrous meat of
animals, and dried insects; in a word, of the utter absence of
sunshine and the lack of gluten and saccharine bodies in their
food.”</p>

<p>Handicapping conditions may have produced the Lapps of
the Arctic Circle, the vanished Indian dwarfs of the Andes, the
enigmatic Bushmen, and the little black men of Africa, the
Malay Peninsula, and various isles of the eastern sea. But in
old fables pygmyland is hard by the country of the giants. It
happens that the diminutive Lapp is neighbor to the tall
Karelian, the Bushman and Akka to the stalwart Bantu. There
are little people of the frigid zone, the tropics, and the south
temperate. There were dwarfs of rich ocean littorals as well as
of the tundra, the mountain glen, the desert, and the equatorial
forest.</p>

<p>“I believe mankind was originally a dwarf,” says Leland.
Churchward, in his <i>Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man</i>,
holds that paleolithic man was a pygmy, “the first little earth
man or red man,” and that he was evolved near the Nile springs,
and thence overspread the earth. Sign language and articulate
sounds, the Masonic writer thinks, were worked out by these
little folk. After talking with representatives of their race, he
concludes that they have a monosyllabic speech, and words with
the same sounds as the Egyptian hieroglyphs. The resemblance
of living pygmies to the long-armed, short-legged, paunchy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
dwarf-gods of Egypt and Phœnicia, and notably to Bes, has been
remarked. These squat divinities may have owed their being
to ancient fear of small men, the elder brothers of historic
man. Sir Harry Johnston thinks it possible that the little blacks
once overspread Europe and, by their prankish good nature and
curious power of becoming invisible in herbage and behind
rocks, gave rise to folk-tales of gnomes, kobolds, and fairies.
Kollman, the Basle anatomist, contends that the pygmies were
the child race of mankind, and that each tall race was preceded
by a small one. The common opinion, that healthy dwarf
tribes have been produced by degeneration from men of larger
mold, is not fully satisfying. Yet the oldest human skeletons
found thus far are of men of normal size.</p>

<p>There are pygmies, but why? The one riddle succeeds the
other.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c12">Chapter XII. The Amazons of Legend</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Men</span> gave up with regret, and not so long ago, and not until
they had ransacked all the horizons of geography, the belief
that somewhere in the world there is a state of warrior women.
They are reluctant to admit, nor have they quite admitted, that
there never was such a state; and still they ransack the horizons
of history and folk-lore for proof that at one time Amazons
were.</p>

<p>Myth has mapped the woman’s commonwealth in western
Africa, in Armenia on the Black Sea, in the Caucasus, in Russia
along the lower Don, in islands of the Baltic, the Indian Ocean,
and the Caribbean, and upon the River of the Amazons. There
is report of it in Greek, Turanian, Arab, Negro, and American
legend. It figures in the poetry of Arctinus, the history of
Herodotus, the mendacities of Maundeville, the narrative of
Marco Milioni, the visions of Columbus, the journal of Orellana
and the Guiana prospectus of Raleigh.</p>

<p>Unlike other ancient tales, the Amazon story, instead of
slowly fading, has grown in definiteness of outline as it approached
to-day. The men who discarded utterly the belief that
there is a woman state lived not long after the men who thought
the state had at last been found.</p>

<p>The Amazons—so runs tradition everywhere substantially
the same—were a tribe of women ruled by a queen and subsisting
by the chase and by wars of pillage. They fought both
on foot and on horseback, using the bow, the spear, the javelin,
and the double-headed ax. Their garb consisted of a short tunic
clearing the knee and fastened over the left shoulder, leaving
the right breast bare. Their outlines were powerful and beautiful.
There was a dispute, never composed, between art and
etymology, as to their bosoms. The word Amazon, though of
barbarian origin, was thought to derive from <i>alpha</i>, privative,
and <i>mazos</i>, the Greek for breast. On this derivation the grammarians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
built up the legend that the right breast of the women
militant was either amputated, or seared, or compressed in
youth, so as not to interfere with the recoil of the bow string.
But the sculptors would not accept this deformation, and statues
and bas-reliefs represent the women with bosoms entirely
womanly. There are recent etymologies wherein “Amazon” is
supposed to mean “full busted,” “moon daughter,” “vestal,”
“girdle-bearer,” or “game-eater.”</p>

<p>One feature of the myth shows the working of inference.
The woman state must sustain its numbers. There must be children
even if there were no men, or the tribe would become extinct.
In place of husbands, therefore, there were what Sir
Walter Raleigh called “Valentines.” Once a year the women
paid a visit to the men of neighbor tribes, or once a year these
men called on them. The women retained the girl children born
of these excursions. As to the boy children, customs differed.
In some cases the mothers nurtured them until they were weaned,
and returned them to their fathers when these came back the
following year, as always they did. In other cases the mothers
put the male infants to death, or maimed them and raised them
as slaves of the state.</p>

<p>The Greek treatment of the myth had a certain other-worldliness.
The Amazons figured in epic events; their struggles were
with demigods. They came to the relief of Troy, and their
subjugation was one of the dozen labors of Hercules. With
him they fought, and with Achilles, and with Theseus, slayer of
the Minotaur, and with Bellerophon, rider of the winged
Pegasus, and with the griffins which guarded Scythia’s fabled
gold; and they invaded Attica to attempt another <i>Iliad</i> in
revenge for the capture of a queen. Greek sculptures and
decorative pottery show the national feeling that these were a
people far removed in time and space. The figures are beautiful,
but something of barbarian wildness animates the features.
Earlier art had represented them as bloodthirsty mænads, raiders
of the borders, but the Greek humanizing spirit wrought
itself upon the legend until the story the sculptors tell is of
men’s regret that they need smite these beautiful savages.</p>

<p>This spirit is in the <i>Æthiopis</i> of Arctinus of Miletus, wherein
Amazons appear on the side of beleaguered Troy. Their queen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Penthesilea, spreads death among the large-limbed Argives
and overwhelms Achilles with abusive words. The angered
hero slays her, but when he removes her helmet the charm of
her strikes him to the heart and he grieves over his victim.</p>

<p>The story, with its fine human touch, recedes into the mists in
a tale which in effect is its epilogue. After his own death and
the ruin of Troy, Achilles reigns over the isle of Leuke, an
Avalon of the East in the Black Sea at the Danube’s mouth.
Thither, even to the land of shades, the rage of the Amazons
for the death of their queen follows him. At their capital on
the river Thermodon in Pontus they seize on ships and compel
the sailors to steer them to the enchanted isle. But as they
approach a temple in the grove their horses take fright and
bolt over a cliff into the sea. A terrible storm shatters the
fleet and few of the vengeful women escape.</p>

<p>In classic legend, there were three woman states—the countries
of the Gorgons and Amazons in the west of Libya, and an
Amazon state in the northeast of Asia Minor near the modern
Trebizond; the capital of the latter was the mythical Themiscyra
on the banks of the river Thermodon, now called the Termeh.
The African Amazons subjugated the Gorgons, and under their
queen, Myrina, marched in triumph through Egypt, Arabia, and
Asia Minor into Thrace, where they were defeated and turned
back by Mopsus. Ephesus, Smyrna, Cyme, and Myrina claimed
them as their founders. This horde was wiped out by Hercules
at the time when he erected the pillar in Africa, for, says
Diodorus Siculus, “it was a thing intolerable to him, who made
it his business to be renowned all the world over, to suffer any
nation to be governed any longer by women.”</p>

<p>It was the Black Sea Amazons whom the Greeks mainly
limned in art and legend. These women, whose earlier home
had been the Caucasus, raided the coasts of Asia Minor and
came to the relief of Troy. The ninth labor of Hercules was
to bring back the girdle of their queen, Hippolyte, a task equivalent
to the subjugation of the state. Theseus carried off another
queen, Antiope, and this led to the Amazonian invasion of Attica;
the fierce women were not halted until they had penetrated
Athens.</p>

<p>This expedition and that of their African sisters were interpreted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
by the Greeks as allegories of barbarian menace. In
the tread of Amazonian horse they may have had a presage of
the hoofs of Hunnish, Turkish, and Tartar cavalry that in after
ages was to ride across their world. Literally taken, the tales
seemed to Strabo incredible. “For who can believe,” he asks,
“that an army of women, or a city, or a nation, could ever subsist
without men, and even dispatch an expedition across the
sea to Attica? This is as much as to say that the men of those
days were women, and the women men.”</p>

<p>Twice, however, in the field of legend over which Strabo cast
an unbelieving backward glance, the note of reality, or perhaps
of realism, had been sounded. When Alexander the Great was
in Parthia, Thalestris, the Amazon queen, paid him a Sheba-like
visit at the head of a hundred women carrying double-headed
axes and the traditional half-moon shield. He was the
bravest of men, said the lady, and she the bravest of women.
They owed a duty to posterity to raise offspring in whom the
two strains should conjoin. The appeal flattered the vanity of
the Macedonian, nor was he averse to meeting its conditions.
So runs a Greek story like unto others with which the Alexander
legend was embroidered. But Arrian explains that the
so-called queen and her followers had been sent as a present
by the governor of the next province—a time-honored Asiatic
gift.</p>

<p>There was a battalion of death perhaps three thousand years
before the young women of Russia took the field in the World
War, and those of Poland in the war that followed it. The
story is told by Herodotus in a chapter which begins in myth
and seems to pass into history. In the opening scene three
shiploads of Amazons, captured in the Attic campaign already
noted, overpower the Greek sailors and slay them all. They let
the ships drift across the Black Sea and beach on the shores of
the Palus Mæotis (Sea of Azov), where the women seize a herd
of horses. Mounting them, they fall to plundering the land of
the free Scythians. Herodotus continues:</p>

<p>“The Scyths could not tell what to make of the attack upon
them—the dress, the language, the nation itself were alike unknown;
whence the enemy had come, even, was a marvel.
Imagining, however, that they were all men of about the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
age, they went out against them and fought a battle. Some of
the bodies of the slain fell into their hands, whereby they discovered
the truth. Hereupon they deliberated, and made a
resolve to kill no more of them, but to send against them a
detachment of their youngest men, as near as they could guess
equal to the women in number, with orders to encamp in their
neighbourhood and do as they saw them do. When the
Amazons advanced against them, they were to retire and avoid
a fight. When they halted, the young men were to approach and
pitch their camp near the camp of the enemy. All this they
did on account of their strong desire to obtain children from
so notable a race.”</p>

<p>The Scythian youths were sent out. The Amazons saw that
no harm was meditated against them and desisted from further
attack; and slowly the romance unfolded. Day after day the
camps were pitched nearer each other, and both parties, having
naught but arms and horses, supported themselves by the chase.
“At last,” says Herodotus, “an incident brought two of them
together. The man easily gained the good graces of the woman,
who bade him by signs to bring a friend the next day, promising
on her part to bring with her another woman. He did so, and
the woman kept her word. When the rest of the youths heard
what had taken place they also sought and gained the favor of
the other Amazons.</p>

<p>“The two camps were then joined in one, the Amazons living
with the Scythians as their wives; and the men were unable to
learn the tongue of the women, but the women soon caught the
tongue of the men. Then the Scyths said: ‘We have parents and
properties; let us therefore give up this mode of life, and return
to our nation, and live with them; you shall be our wives there
no less than here, and we promise you to have no others.’”</p>

<p>But the young women would not go home with their husbands
to live with their mothers-in-law. “Of womanly employments
we know nothing,” they said. “To draw the bow, to hurl the
javelin, to bestride the horse, these are our arts. Your women
stay at home in their wagons engaged in womanish tasks and
never go out to hunt or to do anything. We should never agree.”
So they bade the bridegrooms go back to their parents, ask for
their inheritances, and return. This the youths did, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the Amazons told them they could no more get along with their
fathers than with their mothers. They had stolen horses and
wasted the ancestral lands. “As you like us for wives,” they
pleaded, “grant the request that we leave the country together,
and go and dwell beyond the Tanais” (the river Don).</p>

<p>Again the Scythian youths consented, and all fared to a region
three days’ journey east and three north of the Sea of Azov.
Thus was founded the race of Sarmatians. From that day
to this, concludes Herodotus, the Sarmatian women ride with
their husbands in the chase, and in war take the field with
them. Nor does a girl marry until she has killed a man in
battle, so that among them are women of advanced years,
celibates because they have never struck down a foe. Also, the
Sarmatians do not speak the tongue of Scythia correctly, because
the Amazons learned it incorrectly at the first.</p>

<p>At least the topography of the tale has been confirmed.
Sarmatia is the ancient name of Poland and Niebuhr has traced
the westward drift of the tribes from the Don steppes to the
great Hungarian plain, whence they overspread Poland and Russia.
One could wish to believe that Maria Botchkareva, commander
of the Battalion of Death that took the field against
Germany when the manhood of Soviet Russia faltered and
grounded arms, is of the high Amazonian strain.</p>

<p>The Indian epic of the <i>Mahabharata</i> has a similar tale, although
in less realistic vein. There was a religious rite known
as the Aswamedha, in which a leader would loose a horse, and
follow it for a twelvemonth into whatever adventures and countries
it might go—a quest entailing wanderings and warrings.
Rajah Arjuna of the Gangetic city of Hatusapur took the pledge,
and in the fifth stage of his adventure followed the ranging horse
into the Country of Women. He entered it with heavy heart,
knowing its danger.</p>

<p>These were not like other women, but rakshasis, or goblin
women. Their queen, the Rani Paranunta, was a beautiful
young creature, and so were all her women. But their customs
were worse than Circean. When men entered the land they were
kindly entreated and beguiled into remaining for a month or
more; and, indeed, there were guards to prevent their escape.
After thirty days they were killed, and such of the women as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
had entertained them, but were not expectant mothers, took their
own lives—the suttee. Thus was it assured that the Country of
Women should always be also the Country of Young Women.</p>

<p>The roving rajah and his train were gloomily pondering these
customs when they saw a troop of Amazons appear, and lead
away the Aswamedha horse to the stables of their queen. These
were young girls, all between the ages of fifteen and sixteen,
arrayed in pearls and rich stuffs, with bows in their hands and
quivers at their waists and proud horses under them. Among
them rode their queen on an elephant. And she bade Arjuna to
cease his quest. “Become my slave, drink with me, and pass
your time in pleasure,” said the young Rani.</p>

<p>Arjuna reminded her that this was an invitation to die thirty
days later. To which the Rani replied that really it should make
little difference to him: “If you resist me you fall by my arrows;
if you remain you have to face the light of my eyes.” Already
her beauty had overcome his heart, but his mind made a last
appeal. Let her permit him to fulfill his vow and he would
come back to wed her and would find noble husbands for all
her women. The young queen liked the speech and sped him on
his way to other adventures, and the tale itself to its ultimate
happy ending.</p>

<p>In a fortified palace in an iron city of Ceylon—Hiouen
Thsang tells the story—dwelt other goblin women to the number
of five hundred. On their towers flags flew to attract passing
ships. When merchants were sighted, the rakshasis took the
form of beautiful maidens holding flowers and strewing scents,
and with music welcomed them to the iron city. There was a
prelude of wanton pleasure and then the strangers were shut up
in an iron prison and devoured at leisure.</p>

<p>Hither came Simhala, prince of the merchants, and five hundred
of the trader-folk, while the lucky signals waved on the
towers of the siren host. Simhala mated with their queen, and
each of the men found a companion, and of each union a son
was born. But an evil dream came to the prince, and he went
in the night to the iron stronghold, whence a captive’s voice told
him who the women were and what he might expect. If he would
escape, there was a divine horse on the seaboard that would
carry him away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>The next scene shows the goblin women, each with her child,
questing the air in search of their fugitive husbands and by
blandishments persuading them to return. Simhala alone stands
out. But his deserted queen, hastening before him to his father’s
house, wins the elder man for her husband, and then brings on
the demon women for a carnival of death. In the morning the
royal ministers find in the palace hall no living thing, but only
gnawed bones. The remainder of the story tells of the vengeance
of the son in a second expedition to the Isle of Gems.</p>

<p>“Then,” says the narrative, “the rakshasis were driven back,
and fled precipitately to rocky isles of the sea.” There for a
while we must seek the warrior women.</p>

<p>Marco Polo found them “about five hundred miles toward
the south in the ocean” from Sind. Here were two islands thirty
miles apart, supposed by modern geographers to be the Two
Sisters lying near Socotra. One, inhabited solely by men, was
called the Island of Males; the other, inhabited solely by women,
was called the Island of Females. In March, April, and May the
men lived with the women, and at the same time sowed grain
in the fields. The rest of the year, because of the climate, the
men lived in their own island, knowing that if they stayed with
the women it would be “at the risk of falling a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>In Siamese folk-lore the Amazon island is farther to the east,
in the Mergui archipelago, where lies the Country of Widows,
or See-Saw Country of Widows—a vanishing city where are
women only, and nothing can float on water. Still farther east,
legend—Arabic, mediæval, and modern—tells of women commonwealths
in Engano; in the “Sea of Malatu,” identified as
a bay of North Borneo; and in an island not far from Samar
in the eastern Philippines. Even in the Ladrones and the Carolines
the Jesuits heard of female islands. Pigafetta was told by
a pilot of an island called Acoloro, which lies below Java Major,
where are found no persons but women, and these become pregnant
from the wind. They kill their male offspring and any
men who visit their island.</p>

<p>The name of California, borne by an American state, was
given by mediæval legend to an Amazon island “on the right
hand of the Indies very near to the terrestrial paradise.” Although
troglodytes, the pirate women who inhabited it lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
luxuriously. Their arms and armor were of gold and their
caves were richly tapestried and adorned with gems and feather-work,
won by plunder of passing ships.</p>

<p>In the <i>Arabian Nights</i> the Amazon legend becomes entangled
in other myths. Hassan el Bassorah loves and weds a strange
and beautiful woman, but she flies away to the farthest of an
archipelago of seven islands ruled by her father. He has an
army of twenty-five thousand women, “smiters with swords and
lungers with lances.” The daughter queens it over the island
of Wak-wak. Here there is a forest the trees of which bear
fruit with the faces of the sons of Adam. When the sun arises,
these exclaim, “Wak-wak, Glory to the Creating King,” and
when it sets, “Wak-wak, Glory to God.”</p>

<p>Lane, translator of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>, adds a
note that the island of Wak-wak, familiar to Arab legend, lay
near Borneo. A queen swayed it and her warriors were beautiful
women. Even the trees bore women who hung by their hair
from the branches and syllabled, “Wak-wak”; if their hair was
severed, they died. Another editor, Burton, holds that there
were two Wak-waks. One was the peninsula of Guardafui
where the pagan Gallas cried “Wak” as the Moslems cried
“Allah”; the vocal fruit tree was the calabash tree, “a vegetable
elephant,” the gourds of which hang by slender filaments. The
other Wak-wak was an island identified as Madagascar, as
Malacca, and as Sumatra. Sometimes the Cantonese speak of
Japan as Wo-kwok, and in New Guinea birds of paradise,
settling on trees, are supposed to cry out “Wak-wak.” This is
also the name of the Falcon-man among the First People of
American myth, and of Philippine sorcerers who could disconnect
their legs and fly about like bats.</p>

<p>The narrative of Maundeville brings legend west again. Beside
the Land of Chaldea is the Land of Amazonia. The woman
state emerged when the king and all his nobles were slain in
war. The high-born relicts slew all the men left, “for they
would that all the Women were Widows as they were.” Thereafter,
“they never would suffer Man to dwell amongst them
longer than seven Days and seven Nights,” and when they met
their lovers in neighboring realms they lived with them only
“an eight Days or ten.” These “wise noble and worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Women” fought valiantly as mercenary soldiers for neighbor
states.</p>

<p>There was an island of women in the Baltic, according to
Adam of Bremen, but he perhaps confused Gwenland, or Fenland,
with the land of gwens—that is to say, the land of women.</p>

<p>That there was an Amazon nation in America the Chinese
were first to report. Buddhist travelers of the sixth century
told of a Land of Women beyond the Pacific in what may have
been Mexico. Of this report the Spaniards knew nothing when
they gave the legend a home in the Caribbean Sea, in islands
that were halfway houses in time and space to its wild but
splendid domicile on the mainland of South America.</p>

<p>The maps which Columbus knew had drawn into their contours
of the Orient the outlines of various islands of women.
In the Catalan map of 1375 the <i>regio feminarum</i> was placed in
Ceylon. The fifteenth-century Catalan map placed the <i>insula
de bene faminill</i> in the west of the Indian Ocean and off the
African coast. A map of 1489 now in the British Museum had
the <i>insula mulierum</i> and the <i>insula virorum</i> not far from
Zanzibar. These were islands of the east, and Columbus
thought he was sailing into the east, and he had with him the
<i>Travels</i> of Marco Polo with their account of the isles of men
and women. It was confirmation of his hopes that shortly after
his landfall in the Bahamas the natives spoke, or seemed to
speak, of the island of women.</p>

<p>Through January and February of 1493 the journal of
Columbus has much to say of the <i>Isla de Mugeres</i>, of which
many Indians had told him. Its name was Madanino, the modern
island of Montserrat. There was a companion island of men
called Carib, a dozen leagues away. Columbus wanted to visit
both, although the men were cannibals, and to carry away a few
of the Amazons as a present to his sovereigns. But somehow
he never made this expedition.</p>

<p>On the second voyage Columbus unwittingly touched at another
island of women. It was Guadeloupe, where “abundance
of women [his son Ferdinand is the narrator] came out of
a wood, with bows and arrows and feathers, as if they would
defend their island.” They were naked, with long hair falling
over their shoulders. The admiral sent two Haytian women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
swimming ashore to barter for food. The armed women bade
them go to the north side of the island “where their husbands
were.” But a landing party of Spaniards brought back ten
women and three boys—and report of an adventure. One of
the captives, wife of a cacique, had been pursued by a swift-footed
Canaryman, and him she threw down and had nearly
throttled before his companions pulled her off. Although
nimble, the women were excessively fat, “and there were some
thicker than a man could grasp.”</p>

<p>The cacique’s wife told the Spaniards that the island was inhabited
only by women, and that four men they had seen were
there by chance from another island; “for at a certain time in
the year they come to sport with them.” There was another
Amazon island called “Matrimonio.” Having seen the prowess
of these women, the admiral readily believed their stories. He
dismissed them with presents, but the Amazonian wrestler had
conceived a passion for a Haytian prince whom he held captive,
and remained with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Other explorers after Columbus mistook for Amazons various
island women who fought them when their husbands were away.
The conquistadors even imagined that the convents of Mexican
virgins, who followed the austere rule of Quetzalcoatl, were
Amazon barracks in which, at seasons, men were made welcome.
Thus by a succession of reports the stage was prepared for
the revelation made by Orellana, when in 1542 he slipped away
with a party of men from the spice-hunter, Gonzalo Pizarro,
who was encamped near the headwaters of the great river—from
that time forth called the River of the Amazons—and
descended its broadening bosom to the sea.</p>

<p>At the mouth of its affluent, the Rio Negro, Orellana had a
spirited fight with a band led by a number of women. An Indian
captured farther downstream told him that this was a district of
women. Their five Houses of the Sun were plated with gold,
their dwellings were of gold, and strong walls encompassed their
cities; and their country was neighbor to El Dorado. This
story, brought back to Europe with much corroborative detail,
inflamed it, and Spain gave its author a commission to conquer
and colonize the lands he had skirted afloat. But he died on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
his outward passage, and these lands, falling within the territories
of Portugal, Spain had no profit of them.</p>

<p>Thenceforth the legend of the American Amazons followed
its curious course for three centuries, while the credulity and
cupidity of men wove for it a background bizarre in its colors
and stiff with fabled gold.</p>

<p>Raleigh’s is the best account—such a recital as must interest
his sovereign, the Virgin Queen. The nations of these warlike
women, he said, were on the south side of a northern affluent of
the Amazon in the province of Topago, “and their chiefest
strengths and retracts are in the Islands situated on the South
side of the entrance some sixty leagues within the mouth of the
sayd river. They accompany with men but once in a yere,
and for the time of one moneth, which I gather by their relation
to be in April; and that time all kings of the borders assemble,
and queenes of the Amazones; and after the queenes have
chosen, the rest cast lots for their Valentines. This one moneth,
they feed, dance, and drinke of their wines in abundance; and
the Moone being done, they all depart to their owne provinces.</p>

<p>“It was farther tolde me, that if in the warres they took any
prisoners, that they used to accompany with those also at what
time soever, but in the end for certeine they put them to death;
for they are sayd to be very cruell and bloodthirsty, especially
to such as offer to invade their territories. These Amazones
have likewise great store of these plates of golde, which they
recover by exchange chiefly for a kinde of greene stones which
the Spaniards call Piedras hijades, and we use for spleene
stones.”</p>

<p>Even without the imported wealth of Old World legend—the
tales of pygmies and vampires and headless folk with which
adventurers decorated their narrative—it was a singular backdrop
of tradition before which the female warriors of America
were paraded. Through its colors ran the primitive lusts of
men—for gold and women. The English sought gold, the Indians
sought women, and the Spaniards, so Raleigh said, sought
both gold and women. The natives were fighting over women
a succession of Trojan wars, in which copper-hued Helens passed
back and forth as the booty of the victors. Indian nobles
with a dozen wives envied the polity of other tribes where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
caciques had half a hundred apiece. When Raleigh asked
Topiawara’s people what he should wrest from the Epuremi,
they replied “their women for us, and their gold for you.”</p>

<p>Of such a world anything might be true, and Amazon proof
kept coming. The soldiers of de Agira, as Lopez Vaz records,
“did finde that to be true which Orellana had reported, that there
were Amazons, but these women fight to aide their husbands.”
Father de Acunha, who went with Teixera on his great journey
of exploration, asserted (1698) that the large ladies of fable
had “treasures enough to enrich the entire world.” Their
realm was the summits of the Cordilleras of Guiana. The
males of the neighboring Guacaris were “the happy tribe
which enjoys the favor of the valiant Amazons,” and these dwelt
well up the sides of the mountains where the women throned it.
When the men made their yearly call, their hostesses met them
on the frontier with arms in their hands, which, however, they
soon put aside. Each Amazon chose a hammock at random
from the canoes of the men, and its owner followed her to her
lodge.</p>

<p>Brazilian folk-lore fitted into the legend. The devil-mask of
the Jurupary is supposed to represent the mythical hero who
came from the Antilles and overthrew the Amazons. All along
their great river bands of women attacked him, but, like another
Hercules, he destroyed them utterly. The cuirass of the conqueror
became a sacred mask, and it was said that Indian
women would hide in the forests rather than look upon it, so
poignant was its reminder of their overthrow.</p>

<p>In another story, found upon the middle Amazon, the Indian
women abandoned their lords and retired to the hills, taking
one old man with them. The oldster became the father of all
children born to them, and only girl babies were reared. One
mother, however, had a crippled son, and in pity she secreted
and reared him, and cured his deformity. When his retreat was
discovered there began, says Rothery, a long and tender persecution
from the women, though the boy remained unmoved. To
escape this he agreed that his mother should throw him into a
lake, where he became a fish. Whenever the mother called him
he swam ashore, changed to his beautiful human form and took
food from her hands. This secret, also, was discovered, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
other women would imitate the call and inveigle the deceived
youth into their arms. The old man, sole tribal husband of
record, noted the neglect of the women, divined the reason, and
went fishing. Other nets failed to hold his prey, but a net of
woman’s hair caught the boy-fish, and youth was no longer
served; the old man killed him.</p>

<p>Navaho myth tells a related story of the secession of the
women, their cohabitation with a water-monster, and their return
to their natural mates. Fragmentary tales of the woman state
come also from Colombia, Nicaragua, Sinaloa, and the two
Californias.</p>

<p>The Amazon exodus is related in a third story of Brazil,
told by Barboza Rodriguez. When the women abandoned their
husbands, flood and fell barred the way of the pursuers and the
very monkeys pelted them from the trees. After a while the
female republic relented so far as to admit the men once a
year. At length it disappeared into the land of shadows, the
women going down into a hole in the earth, led by an armadillo.</p>

<p>La Condamine, the French geographer and mathematician,
went to Peru in 1735 to determine the length of a degree of the
meridian at the equator, and on his homeward journey made
the first scientific exploration of the river Amazon. He returned
with one certainty and two doubts. He was sure there
had been a woman state, but he did not know whether there
still was, nor where it could then be found, for the Amazons
were nomads who shifted their camps.</p>

<p>The distinguished scientist arrays his evidence: testimony of
an Indian whose grandfather had seen an Amazon band pass by
at the entrance of the Cuchura River and spoken with four of
them; like testimony from other natives; statement of the
Topayos that the green stones called Amazon stones which they
wore were inherited from forefathers who had them from a
tribe of women; statement of an old soldier that he had seen
necklaces of Amazon stones among a tribe of long-eared Indians
and learned they had procured them from the women without
husbands, whose territories were seven marches west; native
name of these women, Cougnantainsecouima, meaning “the independent
women who receive men into their society only in
the month of April”; offer of a native of Mortigua to guide La<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Condamine up the river Irijo which flows hard by the woman
state; passages in the Jesuit <i>Relations</i> of 1726 and reports of
two Spanish governors of Venezuela, Don Diego Portales and
Don Francisco Torralva.</p>

<p>Where are the Amazons now? asks La Condamine. He notes
that while different accounts designate the point of their retreat,
some toward the east, others the north, and others again
the west, these several routes converge in one common center,
the mountains in the midst of Guiana. But without further
proof he will not credit the existence of the woman state there
in his time. The tribe may have moved again. “Or, what to
me appears a more probable event than any other, it will have
forsaken its ancient habits, either in consequence of being overpowered
by some other nation, or of the maidens’ having at
length lost the aversion of their mothers to the company of men.
Thus, though no remaining vestige should be found of this
feminine republic, this would not yet prove that none such had
ever existed.”</p>

<p>The majority of the natives of South America, La Condamine
declares, are liars, credulous, and prone to the marvelous. But
none of them, he urges, could have heard of the Amazons of
Diodorus Siculus, and Justin previous to the arrival of the
Spaniards; yet even then Amazons were spoken of as existing
in the center of the country, and later reports come from tribes
that never had held commerce with Europeans.</p>

<p>If ever there was such a nation, concludes La Condamine, it
must have been in America. The Indians were constantly
wandering. Their wives often went with them to war. They
had plenty of chances to get away from the men, and provocation
enough in the hard estate of slavery in which they were
held. Why could not these aboriginal women do what even
imported slaves had done? Negroes in Latin America had fled
from their taskmasters into the tropical forests, and there had
reared a dozen Cimarron republics. Thus, weighing evidence,
common report and probabilities, La Condamine casts the weight
of his name in favor of the Amazons.</p>

<p>Two generations later the woman state received the allegiance
of Alexander von Humboldt, founder of the science of physical
geography and largest name among the savants of the nineteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
century. He had spent five years in tropical America at the
opening of the century, and in his <i>Personal Narrative</i> of travel
there he records affirmative answer to the question: Did he
accept the conclusions of La Condamine? There was exaggeration,
he thinks, in the stories of Raleigh and Oviedo; but
nevertheless he cannot entirely reject “a tradition which is
spread among various nations having no communication with
each other.”</p>

<p>Ribeiro, the Portuguese astronomer who had traversed the
Amazon basin, entering it a disbeliever of the story, had found
the same traditions of the woman state among the Indians, and
confirmed all that La Condamine reported a generation before,
Humboldt notes. He is impressed with the contemporary testimony
of Father Gili. The friar had asked a Quaqua Indian
what tribes inhabited the Rio Cuchiviro and the Indian named
three, one of them the Aikeambenanos. The missionary knew
the Tamanac tongue, and in that tongue the word signified
“women living alone.” The Indian confirmed his translation,
and explained that these were a community of women who made
blow-tubes and other weapons of war. After the familiar
Amazon custom they had seasonal amatory relations with the
neighboring nation of Vokearos and sent their men visitors
back with presents, but killed their male offspring. This tale,
says Humboldt, seems framed on the traditions which are rife
among the Indians of the Maranon and among the Caribs; yet
the Quaqua who told it knew no Castilian, had never before
talked to a white man and certainly did not know that below
the Orinoco was the river of the Amazons.</p>

<p>“What must we conclude?” asks Humboldt. “Not that there
are Amazons on the banks of the Cuchivero, but that women in
different parts of America, wearied of the state of slavery in
which they were held by the men, united themselves together;
that the desire of preserving their independence rendered them
warriors; and that they received visits from a neighboring and
friendly horde. This society of women may have acquired some
power in one part of Guiana. The Caribs of the continent held
intercourse with those of the islands; and no doubt in this
way the traditions of the Maranon and the Orinoco were propagated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
toward the north,” so that Columbus and other
navigators who followed him heard of them repeatedly before
reaching the mainland of America.</p>

<p>A generation later the woman state is spoken of by Schomburgk,
who traversed Guiana in 1835-43. Everywhere the
Caribs told him of the Woruisamocos, a tribe of warlike women
who lived near the sources of the Corentyne in a district where
no white man had been. They shot with the bow and arrow
and used the blow-pipe. Their own fields they cultivated, and
men came thither only as their lovers, and but once a year.
Schomburgk pushed on to the district where the women should
have been; they were not there.</p>

<p>In the remote regions of the River Amazon’s northern affluents,
says a recent geographer, the women warriors are still
vainly sought.</p>

<p>Thus this world-wide, world-old story has been followed
through perhaps thirty centuries of tradition on four continents
and in five seas; and the end is a doubt. Men have fought with
parties of armed women, but none has found the City of Women.
Stories of male and female islands may have arisen from the
custom of naming companion islets “brother” isles and “sister”
isles, like North Brother and South Brother islands in New
York’s East River. It is contended that Orellana concocted his
tale to divert attention from his desertion of Pizarro; that
Spaniards mistook young Indian braves, with topknots and
berry-bracelets on their arms, for women; and that the prose
behind the poetry of the American Amazons is the tribe of
Naupes, which still wears green stones for amulets. It is even
suggested that the New World legend grew out of the coast
Indian word, <i>Amazuni</i>, to denote a tidal bore upon the great
waterway of Brazil.</p>

<p>It has happened that the vivid imagination of the conquistadors
projected stories among the Indians which came back
later with such a wealth of detail as to seem native stuff. Is the
New World Amazon tradition merely Book III, Chapter XXXIV
of the <i>Travels of Marco Polo</i>, writ large upon the wax-like minds
of savages by the curiosity of Columbus and his great companions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>Before answering, it will be well to turn from stories of a
woman state to authentic records of women who were less than
the Amazons of fable, but more, or rather other, than women of
the hearth. Perhaps the answer is there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c13">Chapter XIII. The Amazons of History</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Whether</span> there have been Amazon states or no, there have
been Amazon queens—warrior women who knew how to lead
and whom men were willing to follow. The portrait gallery of
history has set aside its more spacious halls for women of another
kind, for Helen, Cleopatra, Messalina, Theodora, and
their sisters of blandishment. But women militant have also a
place. Tomyris, queen of the Massagetæ, defeated and slew
Cyrus the Great. Semiramis, legendary queen of Assyria,
matched her adulteries with her victories in arms, won all her
campaigns except the Indian, and, in the words of Strabo, left
her monuments in “earthworks, walls, and strongholds,
aqueducts, bridges, and stair-like roads over mountains.”
Boadicea led the Britons in momentarily successful revolt
against Nero. Zenobia, Arab queen, established the Palmyrene
power over the trade routes of the east and swayed Egypt, Syria,
Mesopotamia, and part of Asia Minor, until the arms and gold
of Aurelian encompassed her downfall. Under the poetess
Telesilla the women of Argos repelled a Spartan attack. Joan
of Arc led the armies of France as a girl of nineteen.</p>

<p>Women have gone to war as single soldiers or in troops, in
disguise, or with husbands, brothers, and lovers. When the
Goths crossed the Roman frontiers their families came with
them in ponderous wagons, and their yellow-haired wives figured
in the Roman triumphs. American Indian women, as the
Spaniards found, were able to use the bow, and defended their
homes when their husbands were away, and sometimes went with
them in battle. The aftermath of a victory among various tribes
of North American Indians—the scalping of the dead, the torture
of the living—was intrusted to the women. They bear
their part in the Mexican revolutions. Thus Ibanez puts it:
“The army is composed of men and women. No one has ever
decided which of the sexes makes the better soldier.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>To count the women, the Spanish author says, is to count the
Mexican soldiers, for every one has a wife along, and more
often than not a string of children. The woman is called a
“soldierette” or a “hard-tack,” and if her man is tiring of her,
“the Indian”; and generals have their “generalettes.” Women
constitute the commissary of the army. Each carries bedding
for herself and man, a basket, and perhaps a parrot. With
her sisters she forms an advance guard several miles ahead of
the main force when the troops are on the march. When the
latter reach camp they find the fires burning and a stew in the
pot. The stew comes out of the basket and the basket is filled
by foraging along the way. The Mexican hard-tack does this
thoroughly, Ibanez thinks: “She passes over the country like
a scourge of God. Along her path not a tree remains with a
piece of fruit, not a garden with a turnip, not a coop with a
chicken, not a barnyard with a pig.” When a soldier dies his
companion passes to another through the swift courtship of
circumstance; and sometimes she seizes the rifle of her fallen
mate and uses it in his stead.</p>

<p>Among nomad peoples women have always shared the activities
of the men; the seclusion of the harem is for settled folk.
The chronicles and legends of High Asia have their instances
of feminine prowess in arms. Marco Polo devotes a chapter
to Aigiarm, daughter of Kaidu, king of Great Turkey and
nephew to the Grand Khan. She would marry no man, she
said, who could not overcome her by force. Suitors came from
other lands and wrestled with her before the court. Her hand
was the prize of success and a hundred horses were the forfeit
of failure. “In this manner,” says Marco, “the damsel gained
more than ten thousand horses, which was no wonder, for she
was so well made in all her limbs, and so tall and strongly
built, that she might almost be taken for a giantess.” In war she
fought beside her father.</p>

<p>From Usbeck ambassadors at Delhi François Bernier heard
vaunts of the Amazonian ferocity of the Tartar women. One of
their stories was of the campaign of Aurungzebe against the
Khan of Samarcand. A score of Mogul horsemen had plundered
a village and were binding its people to sell them as
slaves, when an old woman said: “My children, be not so cruel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
My daughter, who is not greatly addicted to mercy, will be here
presently. Should she meet with you, you are undone.” With
a laugh the horsemen tied her up also, and started with their
captives across the plain. The old woman kept looking behind
her, and at last uttered a scream of joy.</p>

<p>The raiders turned and beheld a cloud of dust, and in the
midst of it a young woman furiously riding. Raising her great
voice, like the heroines of Russian epic, she bade them loose their
captives and she would spare them. The horsemen heeding
not, her bowstring twanged and twanged again. Four men
tumbled from the saddle, shot at a range beyond their own
arrows. The young Amazon galloped in among the others, slew
the greater part with her unerring bow, and with her saber cut
down the rest.</p>

<p>There may be an element of romantic exaggeration in each of
these stories. But they make the point that the women of the
Asiatic highlands knew the bow as well as the distaff, and they
bring the tradition of female warriors into the region where
Greek fable placed the Amazons. There are continued references
to women bearing arms in Armenia, in Kurdistan, and in
the early wars of Islam in Arabia. Women in armor fought
with Miltiades of Pontus against the Romans. The seventeenth-century
traveler, Sir John Chardin, had adventure with a ragamuffin
and lewd-tongued queen of the Mingrelians. The Prince
of Georgia said the women of the Caucasus rode as well as the
men, and he accepted the Amazon legend. When Father Angelo
Lamberti was in Mingrelia in 1654, word came that among the
dead in a raiding force from the Caucasus were a large number
of women. They wore complete coats of armor over bright-red
woolen skirts. Their half-boots were adorned with brass
disks and their gilded arrow-shafts bore heads shaped like
the new moon.</p>

<p>As late as the Crimean war “the Black Virgin,” a Kurdish
woman, paraded at the head of a thousand horsemen before the
palace of the Sultan in Constantinople, and led them away to the
campaign on the Danube.</p>

<p>The outlines of a veritable woman’s state almost take shape in
Bohemian chronicle and legend of the eighth century. There
was a Slavic queen named Libussa who is supposed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
founded Prague and built its imperial palace. She exercised
her sovereign will by marrying a peasant, instituting a Council
of Virgins, and giving women preference in the posts of state.
When she died in 838 and affairs returned to the old footing,
Valasca, her chief woman counselor, undertook to found a
female commonwealth. Thus far more or less authentic history;
legend adds that for a while the commonwealth really was, and
that under it girls were trained to arms, while boys lost their
right eyes and thumbs.</p>

<p>St. Bernard organized the Female Crusade in 1147, in which
bodies of armed women marched. The tradition of fighting
women was kept alive in western Europe in the Middle Ages by
girls who accompanied their knightly lovers as pages, and with
them entered the chants of balladry. It was nurtured by the
romances of chivalry, in which disguised female warriors like
Bradamante, “in prowess equal to the best of knights,” figured.
But when, for the first time in the modern era, the Amazonian
impulse seized upon masses of women, there was needed, not the
modulated voice of the <i>trouvères</i>, but the Gothic accent of a
Carlyle to tell of it. The phenomenon is known as the Insurrection
of Women, the march on Versailles of October, 1789.</p>

<p>This was the sudden inspiration of perhaps ten thousand
women drawn from the Central Markets and other rallying
places—“robust dames of the Halle, slim mantua-makers,
ancient virginity tripping to matins, the housemaid with early
broom.” The mob, continues Carlyle, storms tumultuous, wild-shrilling,
toward the Hôtel de Ville. There Theroigne de Mericourt
leaps astride a cannon, her chariot on to Versailles.
Mænads clamor behind. It is the cause of all Eve’s daughters,
mothers that are or that ought to be. “Paris is marching on
us,” exclaims Mirabeau in the National Assembly as the sinister
murmurs come from afar. Soon the esplanade is covered with
“groups of squalid, dripping women, of lank-haired male
rascality.” They break into the assembly, they compel the king
and queen to show themselves, and they bring them back to
Paris, leaving the monarchy in ruins behind them. The return,
says Carlyle, is “one boundless, inarticulate ha-ha—transcendent
world-laughter, comparable to the saturnalia of the
ancients.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>
<p>Not as idealized figures of the Greek friezes, but as turbulent,
blood-hungry corybantes of earlier Greek story the Amazons
of France emerged, almost on the threshold of the nineteenth
century—vanguard of the Revolution. Later the market women
were enrolled in a brigade which wore the Phrygian cap, the
tricolor, a baldric, a short skirt of red, white, and blue, and
sabots. With pike and cutlass, it was their task to escort the
carts which bore condemned royalists to the guillotine. There
were also armed battalions of women and girls in the provinces.
In the external wars of the Revolution about half a hundred
women are known to have fought, young girls in the infantry,
middle-aged women in the cavalry.</p>

<p>French Amazonism was partly portrayed, partly parodied in
the person of Theroigne de Mericourt. She was a popular
actress, in Carlyle’s phrase “brown-locked, light-behaved, fire-hearted,”
who had “only the limited earnings of her profession
of unfortunate female.” At Versailles she cajoled the guard,
“crushing down musketoons with soft arms.” This woman rose
high, and fell far. Suspected of being a Girondist, “the extreme
she-patriots” seized, stripped, and chastised her on the terrace
of the Tuileries, with Paris looking on agrin. Theroigne lost
her wits from brooding over it, and passed out of the Revolution
into a mad-house.</p>

<p>Olympe de Gonges, widow at sixteen, blue stocking, pretended
natural daughter of Louis XV, entered the Revolution at middle
age and countervailed the declaration of the Rights of Man
with a declaration of the Rights of Woman. She tried the
patience of Robespierre and he sent her to the guillotine, after
a jury of matrons had found against her plea that she was “about
to give the Republic a citizen.”</p>

<p>Younger women aped men’s attire and men’s ways. <i>Les
Merveilleuses</i> indecently imitated Roman costumes, going about
in sandals with rings on their bare toes. When a man clad
only in a loin-cloth paraded between two stark-naked women,
the lurking sense of propriety, or of humor, was affronted, and
the group was mobbed. La Maillard, the opera-singer, who was
Goddess of Liberty at the Feast of Reason, wore trousers, fought
duels, and with her female followers went about the streets
to compel other women to dress as she did. This provoked reaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
and the Committee of Safety decreed that women’s political
clubs should disband and no woman henceforth have part
in government. Thus disappear the Amazons of France.</p>

<p>In domestic insurrections and in the defense of besieged
cities, women, as might be expected, figure more largely than
in field operations. Plutarch had told of the women of Argos
who defended their city with such courage that a public decree
gave to them the right to dedicate a statue to Mars, and to their
daughters henceforth the singular privilege of wearing false
beards on their wedding day. The Feast of the Valiant Women
is celebrated in Majorca to commemorate the part taken by
two women in repelling a pirate attack upon an island town.
Spanish women manned the walls of Barcelona during the War
of Succession and provided most of the soldiers that held Saragossa
against the lieutenants of Napoleon. On the maid
Agostina was conferred the honor of bearing the name and arms
of Saragossa.</p>

<p>The most remarkable woman in the Amazon story and, save
Joan of Arc, perhaps the most dramatic figure in the whole
story of her sex, was born in July, 1889, in the Russian province
of Novgorod. The attempt of Maria Botchkareva to prevent the
suicide of her country in 1917, by taking the field with a force of
women soldiers—the Battalion of Death—who were pledged to
obey and not to debate, to shoot the foe and not to embrace him,
has the romance of a lost cause and more. It is related in
<i>Yashka</i>, her utterly frank autobiography, transcribed for her
by Isaac Don Levine.</p>

<p>Out of her old life as misused peasant girl and misused wife
this daughter of Russia marched away into another world where
she could strike as well as be stricken. In the Tsar’s uniform
she seemed just a tall, powerfully built, round-cheeked young
soldier. But under the hoyden of the surface there were commanding
qualities; and it would almost seem that Yashka, as the
soldiers nicknamed her, could see straighter than any man in the
empire.</p>

<p>Her early experiences as a woman soldier in a men’s regiment
were such as perhaps might have been anticipated. She
describes her first night’s slumber in barracks and the blows
and kicks she had to administer to the men on either side. “All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
night long,” she says, “my nerves were taut and my fists busy.”
Soon, however, she won the respect and then the affection of her
comrades, and a corner of the regimental bathhouse was reserved
for her ablutions. She joined in trench raids, herself
bayoneted a German, killed several more with handgrenades,
was captured and escaped, was wounded and shell-shocked, repeatedly
was commended for acts of bravery or mercy; and
kisses greeted her when she returned from hospital.</p>

<p>Then came the revolution, committee rule in the army, incessant
soldiers’ meetings, refusal to attack. With Russia dying
before her eyes, Yashka proposed to Rodzianko, president of the
Duma, a desperate expedient—the formation of the Battalion
of Death. Let the women organize a small command free from
committees and subject to full military discipline. The men
would neither fight nor take orders, but perhaps if their women
attacked the enemy, the men might be shamed into moving
forward behind them.</p>

<p>Rodzianko saw a gleam of hope in the project; Brusilov,
commander-in-chief, approved; Kerensky set his seal on it; and
Maria Botchkareva found herself at the head of two thousand
women of all classes from princesses to peasant girls and
domestic servants. “Who will guarantee,” asked a delegate
at the meeting that authorized this step, “that the presence of
women soldiers at the front will not yield little soldiers there?”
“I will hold myself responsible for every member of the command,”
was Yashka’s spirited reply. “Only discipline can save
the Russian army. In my battalion I shall have it.” And she
did, although the securing it reduced the command she led to
the front to three hundred girls.</p>

<p>“I had a vision,” she said. “I saw millions of Russian
soldiers rise in an invincible advance, after I and my women
had disappeared in No Man’s Land on the way to the German
trenches.”</p>

<p>There was a day in July, 1917, when it looked as if the vision
was to become fact. Artillery had prepared the way for a
general attack. Then the committees began to debate, precious
hours passed, the day declined. Into the Battalion of Death
came nearly a hundred men officers, followed by soldiers who
would rather fight behind a woman than not at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>Rifles were placed in the officers’ hands, and, a thousand
strong, the detachment formed its battle line, every girl flanked
by two men. Coarse jests rose around them, but the laughter
died in men’s throats when the little command leaped the
trenches and went swiftly forward, alone, as it seemed. “Suddenly,”
says Yashka, “we caught the sound of a great commotion
in the rear. In a few moments the front to the right and left
of us became a swaying mass of soldiers. First our regiment
poured out, and then, on both sides, the contagion spread, so
that almost the entire corps was on the move.”</p>

<p>The German first line was overwhelmed and the second, and
the third, Yashka’s regiment alone taking two thousand prisoners.
Then word came that the Ninth Corps, which was to
relieve the attacking troops and continue pursuit, was debating
instead of advancing!</p>

<p>They must needs run for it, for the German counter-attack
was forming. Back over all the trenches they had won at such
cost fled the Russians, the enemy reoccupying them without a
fight. Yashka, shell-shocked, was carried in on the shoulders
of her adjutant.</p>

<p>Thus the great moment of the Battalion of Death came—and
went. Russian manhood was still capable of a heroic thing.
But the chaos which it had made its world could not resolve
into order even at the poignant drama of Russian women marching
alone.</p>

<p>What went before and was to come after was all in keeping.
The tread of the little battalion resounds through scene after
scene of delirium. Behind the lines one hears agitators haranguing
the women. One beholds Kerensky banging his table and,
forgetful he has just abolished capital punishment, threatening
to have Yashka shot because she will not tolerate committee rule
in her command. One glimpses snipers in Petrograd firing on
her women as they leave for the front. Her own angry scorn
flashes out in a violent scene when she reviews the Moscow
Woman’s Battalion—committee ruled—and notes the rouge, the
slippers, the fancy stockings, the evidences of a dubious
familiarity with the men.</p>

<p>There was worse at the front—the men killing their officers
and embracing the enemy; No Man’s Land “a boulevard for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
promenading agitators and drunkards.” Resolved that there
should be some real fighting, Yashka shot a German in the leg
as nonchalantly he approached the lines. Real fighting did
follow; the Russian soldiers turned their machine guns on
their own women. The latter were sent to another sector, and
when the men heard that Lenin and Trotzky had seized control
they celebrated; they tried to lynch the little command. Twenty
girls were killed, the rest fled into the woods.</p>

<p>It was the end. The Battalion of Death disbanded and Yashka
was seized and brought before the duumvirs. They bade her
join them in “bringing happiness to Russia,” and laughed at her
fierce scorn. But they let her go, and she follows her command
out of these pages. One salutes with pride and pain.</p>

<p>About four hundred other Russian women, most of them
Siberians, served in men’s regiments, and the colonel of the
Sixth Ural Cossack Regiment was a woman. There was a
smaller number of female fighters in the Austrian armies, a
few in the German. Women figured also in the conflicts that
followed the World War. The Vilna unit of girl soldiers, about
a thousand strong, suffered heavy losses in the defense of Poland
against Soviet Russia. “Their heads thrown back, they seemed
the very spirit of Poland,” said one who saw them in action.</p>

<p>These were Amazon volunteers. Until yesterday there were
professional Amazons at many of the courts of Asia. The
Celestial King of the Tae-Pings had a regiment of fighting
women. For centuries Indian princes, notably of Hyderabad
and the Deccan, had female guards called Urdu-begani, or
“camp-followers,” on whose loyalty they could rely utterly. A
body-guard of one hundred and fifty girl archers, the loveliest
that could be found in Cashmere, Persia, and the Punjab, rode
milk-white steeds in the service of Ranjeet Singh of Lahore.
There were female sepoys in the palace at Lucknow, female
guards at Bangkok and in Bantam. With their slender bodies
incased in tunics and trousers of rich Eastern colors, with
plumed caps on their small dark heads, and with their erect
and slightly swaggering carriage, these palace troops gave an
added effect of theatricalism to the lesser courts of the Orient.
The Amazon march of the modern stage mimics a reality of Ind.</p>

<p>The <i>Chronicle of the Cid</i> may provide a prologue for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
motley spectacle of Africa’s warrior women which follows here.
Six-and-thirty kings of the Moors and one Moorish queen attacked
Valencia. The queen was a negress, and two hundred
mounted negresses rode behind her, all with hair shorn save a
tuft on the top. They wore coats of mail and wielded Turkish
bows, and their queen drew hers so skillfully that they called
her the Star of the Archers. The Christians centered their attack
on this female cavalry, slew the leader, and dispersed her
force.</p>

<p>Through legend and doubtful chronicle of enterprises Amazonian,
one moves in Africa to a basis of fact as completely
documented as the recent deeds of warrior women in Russia
and Poland. Father Alvares, who went with the Portuguese
ambassador to the Abyssinian court (1520-27), gives it on
hearsay that to the south of the kingdom is a country where
the women have husbands but dispense them from fighting.
Their queen has “no special husband, but withal does not omit
having sons and daughters.” “They say,” says this traveler,
“that they are women of a very warlike disposition and they
fight riding on certain animals, light, strong, and agile, like
cows, and are great archers.”</p>

<p>In his history of Ethiopia, Father Giovanni Cavazzi has two
stories of negro Amazons in the Congo country of the seventeenth
century. One is of the Princess Lliuga, who refused to submit
to the Portuguese and fought until she won a favorable peace.
Her garb was skins; her weapons were the bow, the ax, and the
sword; her battle custom was to sacrifice a man—cutting off his
head and drinking his blood—before attacking the enemy. The
other story is of Tembandumba, a royal negress who must have
known the Amazonian tradition and who sought to establish the
Amazon state. Like Semiramis, she had a procession of lovers,
and slew them as she tired of them. She ruled her state through
women. All male infants, all twins, and all village-born babies
were killed by her orders, and a magic ointment was made from
their macerated bodies mingled with herbs. The queen set the
example by destroying her own boy baby. She told the young
girls that their temporary matrimonial alliances should be
marriages by capture, they to do the capturing in war. The
turbulent career of this one-eyed queen of a cannibal tribe was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
ended by a husband who poisoned her before she had quite
reached the point of doing for him.</p>

<p>Until, in some instances, less than a generation ago, the courts
of Negroland maintained palace troops and other fighting forces
of women. Burton and Rothery have collected their stories. In
the Congo empire of Monomotapa, Lopez found in 1680
battalions of women, armed members of the royal harem. A
generation before, Jinga, queen of Angola, maintained a harem
of half a hundred young men. The monarch of Yoruba boasted
that if the members of his female bodyguard clasped hands, they
could span his kingdom. In the time of the traveler Bosman
the king of Whydah on the Slave Coast had four thousand armed
wives. On the Gle’ lagoon of the Ivory Coast rumor placed a
community of fetish women ruled by a queen who was able with
herbs to develop artificial elephantiasis. These women put
their male infants to death. Dahomey, which lies back of
Whydah, and which became a French protectorate in 1894, was
the best known of African kingdoms—and known for two related
things, its annual Customs of blood sacrifice and its army
of Amazons.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Burton, who went on mission to King Gélélé in
1863, bearing Queen Victoria’s urgent request that he abolish
the slave trade and human sacrifice in his dominions, has written
the account of this nearest modern approach to the Amazon
state. It is a veracious report and it reads like an evil dream.
The <i>Thousand and One Nights</i> has been called a blend of blood,
musk, and hasheesh. The Dahomey story is an African <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, with native beer and trader’s rum in place of hasheesh,
with blood flowing in more turbid torrents than at Bagdad, and
with a ranker musk—and under the musk the overpowering reek
of the body odors of Negroland.</p>

<p>In this nightmare state, half hid behind the swamps and
forests of the coast, one senses the controlling and corrupting
presence of some primitive and abominable religion. Africans,
says Burton, worship everything except their Creator. Those
of Dahomey worshiped, among other things, their ancestors.
The Dahoman sovereign must enter Deadland in royal state,
with a ghostly retinue of leopard wives, head wives, birthday
wives, eunuchs, singers, drummers, bards, soldiers. The retinue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
was swollen yearly at Customs time when criminals and prisoners
of war, publicly sacrificed under the king’s eye, went
drunken and giggling to their doom, while at the same hour
the palace Amazons dispatched female victims to the land of
shades. Throughout the year, whenever the king would send a
message to his deceased father, he killed a subject and forwarded
his soul with it. If he had invented a new drum, or
received a visit from a white man, or even removed from one
palace to another, the soul of some man or woman, slain for the
purpose, must carry the news to the paternal ghost.</p>

<p>It was impossible, says Lady Burton, to venture from one’s
hut without seeing something appalling—skulls on posts, living
victims impaled, evidences of cannibal feasts, animals tied in
every agonizing position and left to die. Burton himself figured
that there was an annual slaughter of at least five hundred
persons, and during the year of the Grand Customs perhaps a
thousand. The institution was strenuously upheld by a powerful
and interested priesthood; “to abolish human sacrifice was to
abolish Dahomey.”</p>

<p>This was the woman’s state, somewhat as early Greek legend
pictured the Amazon commonwealth of the Black Sea, before
art and song refined the fable. Women in Dahomey took precedence
over men and the warrior women called themselves
men. When one of the king’s Amazons walked abroad, a slave
girl with a bell went ahead, and men had to get out of the way.
It seemed to Burton, when he went up from the coast to the
capital city of Abomey, that the older and uglier the slave girl
the louder she rang the bell, and the more she enjoyed the
ignoble scamper of his interpreters and hammock men. The
popular name of these women was Our Mothers. Their official
name was The King’s Wives, a title of courtesy only, for the
monarch had his own harem and these other women were supposed
to be a kind of fighting nuns.</p>

<p>The Amazon army consisted of the Fanto company of the
king’s bodyguard, and the right and left wings, comprising five
arms. The former were distinguished by a headdress in the
form of a narrow white fillet on which was the figure of a crocodile
in blue, and their hair was cropped instead of shaven.
The body of the force was composed of blunderbus women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
elephant hunters, razor women carrying eighteen-inch blades
attached to a two-foot handle, archers with poisoned arrows, and
infantry with tower muskets. The archers were little more than
heavily tattooed, lightly clad camp followers with knives lashed
to their wrists. The elephant hunters were the élite. They
wore knickers under short skirts, their breasts were bound with
linen strips, and antlers were attached to their caps. Other
Amazons had the same uniform, but wore on their shaven heads
small caps on which were blue tortoise figures.</p>

<p>Travelers of two centuries ago computed the female army as
about ten thousand strong. The court may have deceived them
by having the women march like a stage army across the parade
ground, slip around, and come back again; or the kingdom may
have been depopulated by its incessant wars, its blood sacrifices,
the slave trade, and the dedication of a fourth of the females
to the celibacy of arms. When Burton was there in 1863 he
figured the total number of Amazons at about twenty-five hundred,
of whom one-third were unarmed.</p>

<p>The nature of this force seems to have varied from generation
to generation. Travelers report in turn that the Amazons are
cadets of the leading families; that they are slaves made in
war; that they are criminals, common scolds, and women taken
in adultery; that they are loose in morals and that they are
celibates; and that the custom of permitting those no longer
young enough to bear arms to marry was a thrifty substitute for
a state pension. Burton recites the common belief that two-thirds
of them are maidens, the remainder unfaithful wives
condemned to soldiering. He thinks pretty well of their morals,
which were protected by tabu, although while he was in Dahomey
the king had to judge the cases of more than a hundred Amazons
about to become mothers. The crime was lèse majesté, for in
theory these were royal brides, but the punishment was moderate—a
few beheadings, and imprisonment, banishment, or
pardon for the rest.</p>

<p>Dahomans themselves supposed that their peculiar institution
was of their own time, had forgotten, what Europe knew, that
women guarded their court two centuries before, did not dream
that back to an unfathomed antiquity, it may be, theirs had
been a woman state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>Burton was present at the annual saturnalia of the Customs,
and to his sometimes sardonic vision all was invested in African
grotesqueness. He noted the immense thighs of the women
officers and found it hard to reconcile celibacy and corpulency.
He described their dances, for also they danced before the king,
“clapping palms on thighs, or on something fleshier.” The
women stamped, wriggled, kicked the dust, and ended with a
violent movement of the shoulders, hips, and loins—an anticipation
of the most modern of popular terpsichorean contortions.
One captain is pictured in terms that approach admiration—a
fine, tall woman with glittering teeth and a gait that was partly
a military swagger and partly a sensuous dance. But the
costumes of all had a phantasmagoric quality—Amazons with
beards of monkey skin, with men’s nightcaps, with red liberty
caps, with fools’ caps, with human skulls, or the lower jaw of
a skull, dangling at the waist.</p>

<p>These women paraded past the king while Burton looked on.
It may be he tried to take notes and tired at the task. His
narrative reads as if his own head whirled with the dancers,
until he could no longer frame complete sentences. He concludes
that it was something like a pawnshop, for the King’s
Valuables went by with his women.</p>

<p>About in his own words and manner, but condensed, this is
the picture:</p>

<p>“Sixteen brilliant banners held horizontally, preceding a
wheelbarrow with a fancy red-and-blue flag. Five huge fans,
followed by razor women. Eight images, of which three were
apparently ships’ figureheads whitewashed, and the rest very
hideous efforts of native art. Sixty-seven women with brown
faces and bead mittens. Twenty-one girls carrying cylinders of
red and white beads. Seventeen women with silver plates
fastened to the sides of their skulls, habited in red clothes and
handling bead cat-ó-nine tails. Twelve women, also in red.
Seventeen fetish pots, three jars, one silver plated urn, attended
by singing women. Twenty casque women with red tunics and
plumes and black horse tails. Eight helmet girls with red
plumes, dark coats, and white loin cloths. Six pieces of plate,
a tree, a crane, a monkey. After singers and dancers, a huge
drum carried by a woman porter. Three large chairs, preceding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
about fifty heavily armed elephant huntresses, clad in chocolate
and dark blue, with bustles of talismans behind and strings of
cowries before. Four pots. A bullock trunk. Fourteen fetish
women in white caps and tunics and bright yellow grass cloth.
Five black girls dressed in blue. A line of 703 women and
girls with country pots of native beer and bottles of trade rum
and gin. A motley group surrounding two women in big felt
hats. A band and a troop of bardesses. Two girls with serpent
flags. Seven troubadour women dancing. Two warming pans.
An escort of bayonet women. Royal equipages hauled by men
harnessed with ropes. A body of armed women preceding
seven umbrellas and drinking rum. A troop of girls with jugs,
ewers, and jars. Twenty blunderbus women in red caps. Six
kettledrum girls in scarlet caps and bodices and blue skirts.
A calabash with a pyramid of four skulls. Two dancing women
with long switching tails. Fifty captive female dancers. An
old cut-glass chandelier. Living representatives of the mothers
of the Dahoman dynasty. A company of singers commanded by
an old woman in a broad-brimmed hat. A stunning salute of
blunderbuses. Good night after seven mortal hours.”</p>

<p>Yet there was no doubt that these fantastic women could fight.
Their frames were as powerful as those of the men, whose military
organization their own paralleled; and their hearts were
higher. They were the king’s own troops with his favor to
vindicate and a tradition to sustain. They had greater ferocity
as well as greater courage than the men—“savage as wounded
gorillas,” Burton called them, and he laid this to their enforced
chastity. With them, two centuries ago, Dahomey conquered
the joint forces of Whydah and Popos, and the women fought
bravely against the French. Travelers who saw them in
maneuver at the annual Customs tell how they charged barefoot
and half naked through barriers of thorny acacia, and emerging,
torn and bleeding, but with impassive faces, passed in review
before their sovereign.</p>

<p>Out of one passage in the history of Dahomey a ray of light
streams. When a king died at Abomey a wild orgy began among
the Amazons of the palace. They took their own lives and they
slew one another. When Sinmenkpen passed to his fathers,
five hundred and ninety-five Amazons died with him; only by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
extorting a solemn fetish oath did Gezo end this custom. There
were similar practices elsewhere. Among the Behrs of the
White Nile, Rawlinson reports, a woman’s guard prevented any
man from approaching the king, except the ministers who came
to strangle him when his end was near. Megasthenes, Greek
ambassador to the court of Sandrokotos at about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 300, says
that the Indian king was surrounded by armed women who
guarded his chamber and attended his hunts in chariots or upon
horses and elephants. Sometimes it was their right to kill their
lord, and the slayer married his successor. In Bantam half a
century ago the king was escorted by a girlish cavalry that rode
astride and carried muskets and lances; it was said that if he
died without issue the custom was for them to meet and elect a
new sovereign.</p>

<p>When kings died, their women guards functioned. It was
the function of priestesses of death. This is the secret of the
Amazon legend and the key to practises of human sacrifice and
periodic and indiscriminate sexual intercourse with which, alike
in Asia, Africa and America, the legend is associated.</p>

<p>Before fitting the key into the lock of legend it will be well
to let the rule of reason say its word. That large bodies of
women should withdraw themselves from the state, abjure the
society of men altogether or except at stated intervals, live their
own lives and develop their own social tradition, has seemed
to skeptical opinion in all ages a thing not to be believed because
against nature. Yet in all ages women have done before the
eyes of men something very like this. Thousands of them have
gathered in great convents, or as temple harlots have served at
the vast shrines of the Farther East, or as armed priestesses of
the Nearer East have loosed the leash of fable. Their periodic
withdrawals from society for the performance of the Eleusinian
and other mysteries were a routine of the classic civilizations.</p>

<p>There have been times when the woman state was a fact of a
season, or of a year, or more—as when the men of an island
were fishing elsewhere, or the able-bodied members of a tribe
were away on the annual hunt, or the warriors were on a long
campaign; and the traveler, seeing none but women, might misread
what he saw. Doubtless there have been instances where
the men of a tribe were exterminated in war, and their women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
retiring to inaccessible retreats, maintained their independence
for a while. Time was when everywhere the women commanded
and the men obeyed. It is not beyond imagination that, sometimes
and in some places, with the memory of the matriarchate
to inspire them, women have revolted against the cruel lot which
was theirs in primitive society, and set up for themselves; for
they were the daughters as well as the wives of the hard-headed
men of the caves. This is perhaps as plausible as the conjecture
that savage man merely concocted the story to dramatize the
natural antipathy of the sexes, to account for the deep groove
of division which this sentiment had run through primitive
society and to justify the fact that society gave men so much
the better of it.</p>

<p>The roots of the Amazon tradition, however, lie deeper than
what may be called the politics of sex. The truth underlying
the several legends is to be found where, according to report,
the fighting women had their commonwealth. The descendants
of the Cappadocian Amazons who came to the aid of Troy are
to be found in the Armenian highlands. The descendants of
the West African Amazons, on whom, as Diodorus fables, the
vengeance of Hercules fell, are to be found in Dahomey and
near-by negro states. The secret of the Brazilian Amazons is
to be sought, among other places, in Mexico.</p>

<p>With a single word out of the Old Testament the door of
legend opens. Of the Hittites the Hebrew writers seemed to
know only that they occupied mountainous districts in the land
flowing with milk and honey; that for a space the Jews dwelt
with them and “served Baalim and the groves”; and that
Solomon put a tribute upon them. From the rock carvings of
Asia Minor and from Assyrian and Egyptian inscriptions the
present age has learned more. The discovery by Sayce and
other modern scholars of the important place once held by the
Hittites has been called the romance of ancient history.</p>

<p>That place may be likened to the place held by the Ottoman
Empire in its strength. Like the Turks, the Hittites were a
Turanian people who planted themselves across the great roads
of Asia Minor and absorbed and crudely reproduced the culture
of more civilized neighbor peoples. Their capitals were at
Carchemish, where they commanded the fords of the Euphrates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and at Kadesh on the Orontes, whence they ruled Syria and the
cities of the Ægean. They were mountaineers from the Taurus,
with olive skins, mongoloid features, and the Chinese cue. Their
double-headed eagle passed through the Turkomans and the
Crusaders into the imperial arms of Russia, Austria, and Germany;
the Phrygian cap of their successors has become the
headgear of revolutionary woman, and the Turks still wear
their peaked shoes.</p>

<p>The Hittite Empire flourished in the Bronze Age, when it
met Egypt, Babylon and afterward Assyria on equal terms.
It began to loom in the sixteenth century B.C. and it was a
power to be reckoned with until well into the first millennium
before Christ. On its ruins arose Cappadocia, Phrygia, Lydia,
and later Pontus. The rock carvings that proclaimed its sway,
and that Herodotus described but misread, still look down on
the Pass of Karabel along an old road of empire.</p>

<p>The Amazons of Greek legend, according to the convincing
scholarship of Sayce, were the armed priestesses of the Hittites.
Their fabled capital of Themiscyra is the ruined city of Boghaz
Keui in Asiatic Turkey not far from the Black Sea. The authentic
likenesses of the warrior women are to be found, not in
the temple friezes of Attica, but in the rock carvings on the hills
that overlook this ancient ruin. Yet Greek art reflects correct
observation or trustworthy report, for its warrior maidens wear
the kilt of the mountain-dwelling Hittites and carry the same
double-headed ax that is seen in their crude sculptures.</p>

<p>In the service of the Asiatic goddess, known variously as
Astarte, Derceto, Cybele, the Great Mother, and Diana of the
Ephesians, was a multitude of armed priestesses so numerous
that to the Greeks they seemed not a cult but a nation. Whole
cities were in effect mere temple precincts populated by these
women and by eunuch priests; the high priestess of the temple
ruled the city and the surrounding country, and had some claim,
therefore, to the title of Amazon queen. At Komana were
six thousand of these armed maidens of the shrine. At Ephesus
vast throngs of them served a high priestess who called herself
the Queen Bee.</p>

<p>These Hittite women worshiped the Asiatic goddess with orgiastic
frenzies that simulated, or literally repeated, the primal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
processes of dissolution and reproduction. It was easy for the
Greek mariners who saw them dancing to the goddess and flourishing
their weapons on the shores of the Black Sea to infer that
a woman’s capital lay a short distance inland. It was natural,
also, to attribute to them the actual feats of the Hittite armies,
and fable that the cities founded or subjugated by that empire
on the Ægean—Ephesus, Smyrna, Cyme, Myrina—were colonies
of Amazonian origin.</p>

<p>The Amazon legends of Africa and South America and the
customs of the female palace troops of Africa and Asia are
made clear if one goes behind the cult of the Asiatic goddess
to the domain of primitive magic whence it arose. There one
finds beliefs that belt the earth and are reflected not only in
ancient tradition, but in modern practises associated with May
day and Midsummer Eve, with sowing and harvest, with the
summer and winter solstices. Frazer’s examination of these in
the <i>Golden Bough</i> is deeply illuminating.</p>

<p>Following the laws of sympathetic magic, men believed that
in order to make the grain flourish and the grass renew itself
in the annual death and resurrection of nature, it was necessary
by some drama of their own to repeat the phenomena of decay
and of new life. There must be a noteworthy human death
and a resurrection. Sometimes men killed a scapegoat, sometimes
a divine animal, sometimes a divine man—a god-king, as
he was called—such an impersonation of divinity, for example,
as the Grand Lama of Tibet. The killing of the god-king was
preferred as a magic more constraining than any other upon
the forces of nature.</p>

<p>There were several means of simulating the phenomena of
resurrection. This might be done by having two couples appear
in the annual drama—two sets of divine and royal mates.
Frazer suggests that the book of <i>Esther</i>, names and all, is based
on a Babylonian religious festival of this kind—that the gentle
Esther is none other than the lustful Astarte, that Mordecai is the
god Merodach, that Haman is Hannum the Aramite god, and
Vashti a goddess unidentified. The triumph of one set of characters
and the humiliation and death of the other are supposed
to represent the bourgeoning of spring after the long death of
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>The common means of symbolizing and constraining the
reproduction of new life in nature was through a period of
promiscuous sexual intercourse in which designated persons or
whole populations took part. It was deemed necessary to set
an example to the woods and fields, and in the woods and
fields it was set. The saturnalia, the carnivals, the May Days
and St. John’s Eves of old time were not, in intent, excursions
into debauchery; they were exercises in sympathetic magic. So
it befell that in savage vision the withered leaf and the green
shoot, winter and spring, death and resurrection, came to mean
two things—periodic murder and lust.</p>

<p>After a while the priest-kings sought escape from the custom
that gave them only a year of life upon their throne of grace.
They chose substitutes—a son, a slave, a malefactor—who for
a few days reigned in their stead, and as a sign of kingship
were made free of their harems, as Absalom went in unto King
David’s concubines in the sight of Israel. The king, or the
mock-king, devoted to death but attended by beautiful women,
crowned with flowers and worshiped as a god—this spectacle, as
profoundly ironical as life itself, was staged in Mexico when
Cortez came; and when Huc visited Lhasa in 1846 he found the
Tibetans electing a monarch of misrule to carouse and suffer
in place of the pope of Buddhism, God’s vicar for Asia.</p>

<p>The bacchic procession of the doomed king and his women,
this dance of death that went around the world, was the real
Amazon march. It was the part of the warrior women to kill
the man-god whose last days they had beguiled. It was their
part, also, to co-operate with a multitude of men in a lustful
drama, so that every acorn and grass root and grain of corn
might heed the command to bring forth and multiply; back of
the myth of annual Amazon matings with neighbor tribes was
this reality of the saturnalia. In places the legend has suffered
confusing changes, as in the Dahoman Customs, where the king
kills instead of being killed. But the same meaning underlies
the Phrygian worship of the Great Mother, the lethal privileges
of the female palace guards in Hindostan, the self-slaughter
of the warrior women when a king died at Abomey, the going of
women into the hills of Brazil with one old man as companion,
and the recurrent tragedy of the god-man of Mexico, who dismissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the fair partners of his revelry, snapped the strings of
his harp, flung away his chaplet of flowers, and ascended the
altar where an Aztec with a knife awaited him.</p>

<p>The meaning is death and life in nature, and the Amazon as
priestess of both.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c14">Chapter XIV. The Folk of Tradition</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Among</span> the peoples of prodigy there were races without
deformity and yet set apart from other men by their peculiar
habits or habitat, or, as in the case of the giants of geography,
by their unusual stature. Men who dwelt in caves or whose diet
was too much unlike their fellows’ were themes of marvel.
Under fables told about them the outlines of historical peoples
may often be discerned.</p>

<p>While the tall men merge on the one side into the colossal
creatures of mythology, on the other they approach mortal size
and the human quality. Their tradition has been shaped by
nature myths growing out of volcanic eruptions, the phenomena
of frost and darkness, and storms in the desert. But popular
beliefs rest mainly on more tangible things—on the argument
that since there are giant individuals there may well be giant
races; on the actual existence of tall races; on the presumption
that men of old time were taller than those of to-day; on dim
memories of tall vanished races such as the Cromagnous, and
on an ancient notion that the fossil remains of extinct animals
were the bones of giants. Travelers have done much to build
the legend. Almost always they underestimate the mean stature
of a people with many small individuals and overestimate that
of a people with many tall individuals, the usual margin of
error running from two to four inches.</p>

<p>Above all, there has been the witness of geological strata
uncovered to eyes that misread their record. On the basis of
a five-pound tooth and an eleven-foot thigh bone, found in
New England in 1712 and supposed to have been a mastodon’s,
Increase Mather reported to the Royal Society of London that
men of prodigious stature had inhabited the New World. Other
fossil bones found in Switzerland in 1577 became the basis of
a legend, which is commemorated in the colossal statues of
Basle and in the figures supporting the arms of Lucerne, that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
race of giants from sixteen to nineteen feet high lived in the
Alps.</p>

<p>Ctesias reported that the Seres, whom he located in upper
India, reached a stature of fourteen feet and an age of two
hundred years. Onesicritus declared that in those parts of India
where the sun cast no shadow the men were eight feet high. But
ancient writers were neither so specific nor so insistent upon the
existence of a colossal race as later writers have been. Near
the Vale Perilous, says Maundeville, are two islands occupied
by giants. The tenants of the first of these are of comparatively
modest stature, from twenty-eight to thirty feet. Those of the
farther isle are from forty-five to fifty feet.</p>

<p>“I saw none of these,” admits Sir John, “for I had no Lust to
go to those Parts. But men have seen many times those Giants
take Men in the Sea out of their Ships, and bring them to Land,
two in one Hand and two in another, eating them going, all raw
and all alive.”</p>

<p>Amerigo Vespucci found a prodigious people in the island of
Curaçoa off the coast of Venezuela, “every woman appearing as
a Penthesilea, and every man an Antæus.” Pigafetta, writing
of Magellan’s cruise, is responsible for the belief, long held in
Europe, that the tall Patagonians were true Titans. One of them
he pictures as advancing to greet the white men, dancing and
singing and putting dust on his head, as if in token of peace.
The savage towered above the Spaniards, who came only to his
waist. Dismissed with gifts, he returned at length with other
men of a like stature, and two of these the mariners decoyed on
shipboard. Leg irons were placed on them on the pretext that
they were ornaments, but when the Spanish purpose was disclosed
they broke in pieces as easily as if they were the baubles
they were represented to be.</p>

<p>Herrera, Van Noort, Le Maire and other travelers confirmed
the account of the size of the antipodal Indians. Lopez Vaz
described them as “very mightie men of bodie of ten or eleven
foot high, and good bow-men, but no man-eaters.” It remained
for Drake to correct report when he made his own circumnavigation
of the globe. This was one of the “notorious lies” which
the Spaniards disseminated; the Patagonians were “but of the
height of Englishmen”; they are, however, somewhat above it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
Five feet eleven inches is the average among them and individuals
reach the height of six feet seven.</p>

<p>At the other extremity of South America the natives of the
northern Andes have a legend of a monstrous race that arrived
in huge boats at Cape Santa Elena about the beginning of the
Christian era. Their knees stood as high as the heads of other
men and their eyes were like small plates. They abused the
Indians, their habits were abominable, and fire from heaven
destroyed them. This is perhaps a reminiscence of an extinct
civilization, the grotesque art of which has been brought to
light by recent excavations. There is an Oregon tradition of an
underground village of gigantic Indians on Coos Bay. They
bashed each other over the head with heavy bone knives without
being hurt. When the smaller Indians attacked them they fled
down the river and out to sea on two rafts and never came back.</p>

<p>Buffon, who would not credit the pygmies, believed there had
been giants of from ten to perhaps fifteen feet in height. The
Bible narrative giving Goliath, the Philistine bravo, the stature
of six cubits and a span, or three inches above seven feet, is
conservatively phrased. Buffon to the contrary notwithstanding,
it is generally thought that no man ever lived who reached the
stature of ten feet, and no race that reached the mean stature of
seven. A very few individuals have exceeded the height of eight
feet and there is record of one or two who have passed nine
feet. According to the principles governing the distribution
of the overlarge individuals of a race, as worked out by
Quetelet, the appearance of a twenty-foot giant would imply
the existence of a race with a mean stature of from twelve
to fourteen feet.</p>

<p>If there was once a race a foot or so above the stature of
modern man, it may be that the tall individuals who appear in
each generation are not the product of a favorable environment
and fortunate combination of elemental forces, but represent
remote ancestors of unusual size. Zell in his <i>Polyphem ein
Gorilla</i> argues that if races of average height are the normal,
and if there are dwarf races, then there must have been giant
ones to strike the balance. At any rate, tales of such races are
world-wide and a tang as of reality is in some of them. The
Celt, for example, said that giants had a strong body odor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
“Giants,” says Grimm in his summary of their tradition, “consider
themselves the old masters of the land, live up in the
castle, and look down upon the peasant;” the picture might be
of something fabled, or of something vanished.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Macrobians</i></p>

<p>As report gave certain races a great stature, so it gave others
a great age. These were known as the Macrobians. Herodotus
mentions such a people in Ethiopia; “the venerable and harmless
men of Ethiopia,” Walt Whitman calls them. Such also
were the Hyperboreans, on the other side of the north wind.
The tall Seres lived to be two hundred years old. In tropical
India another tall race lived to the age of one hundred and
thirty years, and died just as if they were in the middle period
of life. Some writers called the elderly Indians Gymnetæ,
or Naked Folk. Another Indian people, the Cyrni, were reported
to attain four hundred years. Holding that the Indians
were exceedingly just, and that the just are long lived, the
ancients credited the general statement of Ctesias that the nations
of the Indus live to one hundred twenty, one hundred thirty,
and one hundred fifty years, and the very old to two hundred
years. Pliny adds that they never expectorate and are subject
to no pains in the head, teeth, or eyes. There were Macrobians
in Brazil. A German woodcut of 1505 pictures them at
a cannibal feast, and the accompanying legend says, “They
become a hundred and fifty years old, and have no government.”</p>

<p>There was a reason, named by Isogonus, for the longevity of
the inhabitants of Mount Athos in the Balkans. They used the
flesh of vipers for food, and hence were “free from all noxious
animals both in their hair and their garments.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>Albinos</i></p>

<p>The Albania of the ancients was a country of Asia in the
eastern part of the Caucasus. Somehow the early writers confused
its inhabitants, the Alani, with Albinos. Beeton says that
there is in Albania “a certain race of men whose eyes are of
a sea-green color, who have white hair from childhood, and who
see better by night than by day.” In the kingdom that men call
Mancy in “Ind the More,” says Maundeville, “they be full fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Folk, but they be all pale. And the Men have thin Beards and
few Hairs, but they be long. In that Land be many fairer
Women than in any other Country beyond the Sea, and therefore
Men call that Land Albany.” Also, the hens are white.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Sun-hating Folk</i></p>

<p>There were sun-haters as well as sun-worshipers in the sun-smitten
lands of the older day. Carpini tells of the troglodytes
of the Caucasus who “lived in terror of the mysterious and fatal
sound which accompanied the rising of the sun.” Herodotus
and Pliny describe the Moroccan peoples called the Atlantes.
When they look upon the rising and the setting sun they “utter
direful imprecations against it as being fatal to themselves and
their lands.” If one believes what is said of these tribes beside
the western sea, says Pliny, they have lost all characteristics of
humanity. They do not distinguish one another by names, “nor
are they visited with dreams, like the rest of mortals.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>A Poisonous Nation</i></p>

<p>The Psylli were a nation dwelling near the Great Syrtis on
the North African coast. Pliny, who sponsors them and says
they were exterminated by the Nasamonians, tells a story which
reveals the two great obsessions of the ancients—a curious
credulity as to poisons, and an incredulous curiosity as to the
continence of women. In the bodies of the Psylli, there was by
nature a certain kind of poison that was fatal to serpents and
the odor of which rendered them instantly torpid. It was the
custom to expose newly born infants to the fiercest serpents “and
in this manner to make proof of the fidelity of their wives, the
serpents not being repelled by such children as were the offspring
of adultery.”</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Troglodytes</i></p>

<p>What the moderns call cave-men the ancients called troglodytes.
In the phrase of Æschylus they knew not how to build a
house against the sun, but “lived like silly ants, beneath the
ground, in hollow caves unsunned.” Because they shared the
habitations of bats and snakes, their voices were bat-like in their
shrillness, and with hissing tones; and they ate reptiles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
crickets. They were fleet-footed like the creatures of the rocks,
the troglodyte Ethiopians being, says Herodotus, the swiftest
of men. The inhabitants of the country of the Robbers (Lestai)
in Farther Asia, says Ptolemy, were savages, living in
caves, and “having skins like the hide of the hippopotamus
which darts cannot pierce.” Artemidorus speaks of naked night-traveling
troglodytes of Arabia who put away their dead amid
laughter. There are cave-dwellers to this day in southern Cambodia,
and a Chinese account of the thirteenth century tells of
the skin breastplates which they wore.</p>

<p>The ancients knew of various races of troglodytes, notably
those along both shores of the Red Sea. Others were in Syria,
and upon the Nile, and in Fezzan, and in the Caucasus. The
voiceless troglodytes of Pliny are supposed to be the Rock Tibboos
on whose whistling speech their neighbors still comment.
The best account of the elder cave-dwellers happens to be
authentic history. When Xenophon was retreating with the Ten
Thousand to the Black Sea he found upon the Armenian frontier
a people who lived in underground burrows with vertical
entrances like wells, up and down which they passed on ladders.
Their beasts used a sloping path and lived with them underground,
cattle, goats, and sheep thriving there on green fodder
gathered above. These subterranean habitations were also
granaries and wine-cellars.</p>

<p>With all their lively interest in the ways of troglodytes, the
ancients knew less than the moderns about them, and were perhaps
farther in spirit from the cave-man. In the caverns of
western Europe men of to-day have studied his household
economy, his art, and the animals he tamed or hunted. Travelers
in various lands have come upon underground chambers,
many of them still occupied. In the Berber rock-towns these
subterranean dwellings number thousands, and the ravines which
furrow the plateaus serve as their streets. On the Cappadocian
plain deserted subterranean villages, called <i>kataphugia</i>, or
places of refuge, underlie occupied villages of the surface, and
thither the cattle descend in severe weather, as in Xenophon’s
time twenty-three centuries ago. The peoples of the surface are
supposed to be descendants of true troglodytes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Anthropophagi</i></p>

<p>It never occurred to the early writers to classify men according
to the color of their skins, or the breadth of their skulls,
or fundamental differences in their languages; and the Greeks
and Romans were ignorant of the Noachian genealogy and heedless
of the apportionment of the earth among the sons of Shem,
Ham and Japheth. But they had a rough-and-ready method of
cataloguing savage races according to what they ate, in the
thought that whatsoever a man ate, that in some degree he became.
After naming the races of fable from the size of their
feet or ears or other bodily peculiarity, they grouped and
named, according to their supposed diet, various races of reality
that dwelt at a distance.</p>

<p>Classic writers took passing note of the Anthropophagi, or
tribes that ate human flesh. There were such peoples in Africa
and in Asia. The best known account is the description in
Herodotus of the Issedones. These Scythians of Central Asia
ate the flesh of their deceased relatives prepared with other
meat, and made gold-rimmed drinking cups of their skulls—a
rite of honor to the dead. A tribe in northern Tibet is supposed
to be descended from them.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Ichthyophagi</i></p>

<p>The races that subsisted on fish, the Ichthyophagi, were described
by the ancients with unusual detail. One of the first
accounts is by Herodotus, who tells of the folk that lived on
platforms above Lake Prasias. They drew their fish through
trap-doors from the water beneath, and the custom was that for
every woman a man took to wife he drove three piles into the
lake.</p>

<p>All along the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea there were tribes
of Ichthyophagi. Their very cattle ate dried fish and the beef
had a fishy flavor; Ibn Batuta remarked this in Yemen, and it
is still true of the Coromandel Coast. Arrian’s account of the
voyage of Nearchus describes the Ichthyophagi as occupying for
four hundred miles the barren shores of the Mekran; they had
few boats and were indifferent fishermen, but by intercepting
the ebb tide with palm-bark nets they obtained their food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Arrian repeats a legend of the origin of these tribes in whose
lines one hears faintly the wild music of the Sirens. The island
of Nosala, off the Mekran coast, was the residence of a Nereid
“whose practice was to seduce such mariners as landed there to
her embraces, and then, after transforming them into fish, to
throw them into the sea.” But the sun ordered the nymph to
quit the island and himself changed the fish back into men.
These were the first Ichthyophagi.</p>

<p>Farther west, in Ariana, were fish-eating tribes who made
their dwellings, Strabo says, of shells and of the bones of large
whales, the ribs furnishing the beams and supports, and the
jawbones the doorways. Sections of the backbones of whales
were used as mortars wherein sun-dried fish were pounded.</p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus has a spirited account of the Ichthyophagi
along the Red Sea. This people, he says, do not use nets, but
so wall the caverns and gullies of their rocky shore that the receding
tide leaves the fish imprisoned there. Whereupon, with
a shout, the tribe assembles on the beach. Women and children
gather the little fish next the shore; with sharp goats’ horns the
men dispatch the larger ones, throwing all upon the land. The
booty is put into stone pots tilted toward the south and the fish
are fried by the sun until the flesh drops off. The bones are cast
into a pile and the meat boiled with fruit seeds. Then everybody
falls to and gorges. The heap of bones is a dietary reserve
which the tribe pulverizes and devours when storms shut
off the shore.</p>

<p>The life of these Ichthyophagi is thrown into a sort of rhythm
by the need, every fifth day, of going inland on an extended
journey for fresh water. For four days they fish continually
and make merry in great throngs, “congratulating one another
with harsh and discordant songs; then they fall promiscuously,
as every man’s lot chances, to company with their women for
procreation sake.” On the fifth day the tribe goes in a body to
a district lying under the foot of the mountains where there are
springs of sweet water. Hither, also, the shepherds drive the
flocks. Nor do the shore folk differ much from the herds, for
“they go making a horrid noise and without articulate voice.”
Arrived at the springs, they throw themselves on their faces and
“drink as beasts until their stomachs are distended like a drum.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Slowly they wend their way back to salt water, and for a day
recline without tasting food. The following day they begin anew
their fishing and feeding. Such is the round of their lives.</p>

<p>Diodorus remarks, apparently to commend, that these fish-eaters
“far exceed all other men in freedom from boisterous
passions.” They give no heed to a stranger, nor even look at
one when he addresses them: “Nay, if they be assaulted with
drawn swords they will not stir; and though they are hurt and
wounded, yet they are not in the least provoked. Even though
their wives and children be killed before their eyes, they show
no sign of anger.”</p>

<p>These accounts are not fables. But there is fabulous admixture,
most of it arising from the primitive belief that a fish diet
makes men as cool-blooded as the creatures upon which they
live.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Other Dietary Nations</i></p>

<p>Akin to these nations were the Chelonophagi, or turtle-eaters,
concerning whom Strabo recites facts entirely in keeping. This
tribe lives under the cover of turtle shells, which also it uses as
boats. Some of its members, however, collect seaweed in heaps,
hollow the heaps, and dwell under them. Their dead are cast
into the sea, and carried away by the tide to become food in
turn for the fish and turtles.</p>

<p>The Acridophagi were grasshopper-eaters—insectivorous, ornithologists
would call them. The locust was, and is, a favorite
diet of desert peoples, a staple food of the Arab, as well as of
the pygmy folk and other singular breeds. Niebuhr likens its
taste to that of “a small sardine of the Baltic, which is dried in
some towns of Holstein.” What Dampier has to say of customs
he found in two Pacific islands in 1687 may stand without essential
change for the ways of earlier acridophagi: “They had another
dish made of a sort of locusts, whose bodies are about
one and one-half inches long, and as thick as the top of one’s
little finger; with large thin wings, and long and small legs.
These came in great swarms to devour their potato leaves and
other herbs; and the natives would go out with small nets and
take a quart at one sweep. When they had enough they would
parch them in an earthen pan; and then their wings and legs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
would fall off, and their heads and backs would turn red like
boiled shrimp. Their bodies, being full, would eat very moist,
their heads would crackle in one’s teeth. I did once eat of this
dish, and like it well enough.”</p>

<p>Certain other races living in Africa the ancients knew chiefly
as specialists in diet. Pomponius places the Ophiophagi, or
snake-eaters, on the Red Sea. Homer gives the Lotophagi, or
lotus-eaters, a habitat on the Mediterranean coast. Agatharcides
names the Rhizophagi or root-eaters who dwell on the banks
of the Atbara and subsist on reed roots; and the Elephantophagi,
farther inland, who hunt and eat the elephant. Also in the interior
Diodorus places the ostrich-eating Struthophagi, and there
Pliny places the Agriophagi “who live principally on the flesh
of panthers and lions,” and the Pamphagi “who will eat anything.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c15">Chapter XV. The Horizon Lands</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Not</span> until yesterday did men encompass the earth. But their
minds were always more adventurous than their feet, and from
the beginning, almost, the sense of remote horizons was in them.
Fantastic though its form might be, there was a divine breadth
in their speculation as to the earth and its peoples. The peasant
of antiquity, who knew only his township in Europe or his mountain
canton in high Asia, had yet a vision of continents and distant
seas. His imagination explored the waste places, ascended
the high places, descended into the earth. Its product was the
geography of legend, which gave ground but slowly to the geography
of reality.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Beyond the North Wind</i></p>

<p>One of the earliest countries to find a place in the geography
of legend was that of the Hyperboreans. It lay on the other
side of the north wind. These people lived so far toward the
pole that they were beyond the icy blasts, and beyond all contacts
of war or commerce with the peoples of the south. Only
the priests and the poets knew of them.</p>

<p>The priests knew of them because of the yearly offerings sent
in to the temples of Tempe, Delphi, and Delos. These were
gifts of amber, and virgins bore them from nation to nation
across the whole of Europe. For many years the holy maidens
had honor and hospitality from all the countries along their
path. When violence was done them the journeys ceased. Not,
however, the offerings. The Hyperboreans deposited these upon
the boundary of the people who adjoined them. The latter carried
them to their neighbors; and so by successive stages the
tribute came to the shrines of Apollo, whom the distant nation
held in especial honor. At last the custom fell into disuse.</p>

<p>No return visits were made from the south, for the way was
hard. Yet the poets had, as always, their own means of information.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Homer has nothing to say of the Hyperboreans, but
Hesiod speaks of them, and Pindar, and Æschylus, and a host
of later and lesser voices. From these authorities it appeared
that the Riphæan Rocks, an imaginary prolongation of the Ural
group westward across Europe, shut the Hyperboreans off from
the south. Out of the rocks the north wind came sweeping down
over the lower latitudes, but on the farther side of the range was
summer. It was a favored land, and this a favored people.
“The muse is no stranger to their manners,” says Pindar. “The
dances of girls and the sweet melody of the lyre and pipe resound
on every side, and twining their hair with the glittering
bay, they dance joyously. There is no doom of sickness or disease
for this sacred race; but they live apart from toil and
battles, undisturbed by exacting Nemesis.” Isidore adds that
when the cithara players smite their instruments the swans fly
up and sing very harmoniously.</p>

<p>Rightly discerning that this was no region of the earth, Herodotus
assigns its inhabitants to the realms of fable. But Hecatæus,
Damastes, Diodorus, Pliny and others credit the legend,
though sometimes with a note of doubt, as when Pliny begins,
“Beyond the region of the northern winds, there dwells, if we
choose to believe it, a happy race known as the Hyperboreans.”
From their country Hercules brought the olive. They were a
pious folk, loving justice, dwelling in woods and fields, living
on the fruits of the earth and abstaining from taking even animal
life. No rude winds agitated this delicious land. Here
were “the hinges upon which the world revolves, and the extreme
limits of the revolutions of the stars.” There was but one rising
of the sun for the year, and that at the summer solstice, and but
one setting, and that at the winter solstice; and the day and night
each lasted six months. In the morning of the long day the
people sowed, at midday they reaped, at sunset they gathered
the fruits of their trees; and the long night they spent in caverns;
and so their lives were passed.</p>

<p>They lived to be very old in the country beyond the north
wind, sometimes as much as one thousand years. But a fateful
note runs through all accounts of them. The happy Hyperboreans
were wont to tire at last of their felicity. They ended a
career of feasting and an old age sated with every luxury by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
leaping from a rock into the sea. At the close of each life lay
the rock and the sea.</p>

<p>Just where was this worshipful nation? The answers are
vague and conflicting. On the left bank of the Danube, it was
first thought; on the very verge of Asia, others said. Later its
home was fixed “midway between the two suns, at the spot where
it sets to the antipodes and rises toward us.” There were Greek
writers who confused the Riphæan Rocks with the Alps and Pyrenees,
and confounded the Hyperboreans with the Etruscans
and the Gauls. Hecatæus gives them an island home as large as
Sicily, lying under the arctic pole, over against Gaul. Here
Apollo has a stately grove and a renowned temple in a city where
all the residents are harpers. This is the Britain of the bards and
druids, of whose people it was said in later time that they take
their pleasures sadly.</p>


<p class="large"><i>At the Cardinal Points</i></p>

<p>While the ancients peopled the rim of the earth with deformed
races and monstrous animals, their pictures of the nations
that dwelt at the cardinal points show mainly the ideal
treatment. In the far east, in the far west, in the far south, there
were men like unto the Hyperboreans of the far north. Of the
Indians, the Ethiopians, and the Iberians of early story the same
report was had. They were “just” and “blameless”—these
words recur again and again—and they were long-lived and
fortunate. Thus real races took on some quality of myth. The
classic sense of equilibrium demanded this equal reverence to
the four quarters of heaven, just as it was fancied that, to balance
the Pillars of Hercules in the west, Bacchus had set up
two columns “by the farthest shore of the Ocean stream, on
the remotest mountains of India, where the Ganges pours down
its white waters to the Nysæan shore.”</p>

<p>This cast of thought did not die with the ancients. The epithets,
“just” and “blameless,” reappear in the writings of
eighteenth-century philosophers when they speak of the Chinese.
A little later the beautiful and artless natives of the South Seas
laid upon the thought of more sophisticated lands a spell that
endures. Now, as always, the four points of the compass are
points of fable, and the primitive worship that was paid them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
lurks in the magic with which the number four is invested. The
rising and setting of the sun fixed two of these points and the
course of the Nile northward through Egypt may have fixed
the other two.</p>

<p>“All evil comes from the northeast,” say the Japanese.
Thoreau usually walked southwest. “Eastward,” he said, “I go
only by force; but westward I go free.” Tartar tent doors, as
Marco Polo notes, face south. The mythical Irish voyages were
toward the west. In the thought of many races witchcraft is of
the north. In Norse mythology hell-way is always downward
and northward. When cutting black hellebore the hedge doctors
of Greece faced eastward and cursed. “Altars should regard
the east,” said Vitruvius. Thither the Mohammedan turns
in prayer. The manifestations of God are in the west, says the
Talmud. The Babylonian temples lay due east and west so that
the rising sun would illumine their altars at the equinoxes.
Some of the Egyptian temples were so planned that this would
happen only on Midsummer Day. The older Christian churches
lie east and west, although some of them are oriented to permit
the rising sun to gild their altars on the day of the saint whose
name they bear. The west was the seat of darkness and hence
the rose-window was placed high in the cathedral’s western wall
to illumine the benighted, with the bell-towers flanking it to summon
them to Christ. The eastern side with its altar and the
southern with walls and windows consecrated to saints and
martyrs were both sacred. But the northern, or Black Side, was
Satan’s, and effigies of unclean beasts and sculptured allegories
of lascivious deeds proclaimed it.</p>

<p>The cities of ancient Yucatan had gates toward each of the
cardinal points. With the Aztecs all the world directions were
significant—the north standing for emptiness, the east for sterility,
the west for fertility, the south for good fortune. In the
symbolism of the Navahos, white, the dawn color, stands for
the east; blue, the sky color, for the south; yellow, the sunset
color, for the west; and black, the curtain of night, for the north.
The Pueblo Indians assigned the north to the air, the west to
water, the south to fire, and the east to earth and the seeds of
life. In old Chinese writings the men of the north are called
brave, the men of the south wise, the men of the east kind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
friendly, the men of the west upright and honest. Over the
four cardinal points the old Brahman gods presided.</p>

<p>Thus by a primitive law of the mind illusion lurks in every
corner of the heaven. It lies deepest in the track of the sun.
From east to west go the great wanderers—Hercules, Ulysses,
and the rest—and solar myths thicken along their path through
legendary lands. The east and west dominate the thoughts of
men with their eternal spectacles of sunrise and sunset. Whatever
commerce, geography, or political history may teach them,
the east is still the region of the morning sunlight and the west
of the evening shadow. Though their steps turn westward, men’s
thoughts drift eastward. Though the east be hunger-bitten and
poverty-stricken and its subjugated millions seem to count but
little, it is still the gorgeous east, “the dancing-place of the
dawn.”</p>

<p>Beyond the curtains of the west lie the realms of repose: “If
sunrise,” says Max Müller, “inspired the first prayers, called
forth the first sacrificial flames, sunset was the other time when
again the whole frame of man would tremble. The shadows of
night approach, the irresistible power of sleep grasps man in
the midst of his pleasures, his friends depart, and in his loneliness
his thoughts turn again to higher powers. When the day
departs the poet bewails the untimely death of his bright friend;
nay, he sees in its short career the likeness of his own life. Perhaps,
when he has fallen asleep, his sun may never rise again,
and thus the place to which the setting sun withdraws in the far
west rises before his mind as the abode where he himself would
go after death.”</p>

<p>Though the westward journeys of the sun are but a seeming,
their trail lies broad across the spiritual life of mankind.</p>


<p class="large"><i>On the Mountains</i></p>

<p>Half of history has been written in the passes of the mountains.
What lies above these deep saddles of the ranges belongs
in the main to legend. Not much, even now, is known of
the mountain tops, for men do not dwell there. Antiquity seldom
went up to see. The high places of old sacrifice were hilltops,
not mountain peaks.</p>

<p>Men have been content to travel the valleys and, where necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
impelled, to cross the passes. The steeps overhead
seemed fit abode for the elder gods, for giants and dwarfs and
griffins, for dragons whose breath was the avalanche, for ghosts
whose voice was the echo, for the carnal revels of Satan and his
witches; sometimes, also—since legend is its own law—for
cities of enchantment, invisible and beautiful.</p>

<p>Most famous mountain of classic story was the Atlas; the most
fabulous locality, even in Africa, is the superlative of Pliny.
Its summit reached beyond the clouds and well nigh approached
the very orb of the moon. Rugged and precipitous on the side
of the ocean to which it gave a name, it fell by a gentler slope
on the side toward Africa, and dense groves covered its flanks
where streams flashed and fruits abounded. But in the daytime
men were never seen there. All was silent like the dreadful
stillness of the desert. A religious horror stole over those who
drew near. At night, fires innumerable gleamed upon its sides.
“It is then,” says Pliny, “the scene of the gambols of the
Ægipans and the Satyr crew, while it re-echoes with the notes
of the flute and the pipe, and the clash of drums and cymbals.”</p>

<p>The legend of a mountain of nightly tumult and illumination
recurs in Arab and Christian chronicle. Solinus repeats
it. The mountain is Felfel in the Sahara, says an Arab
author of the twelfth century, and genii hold court in towns on
its slopes whence the people have fled. Ibn Khordadbeh places
the realm of nocturnal revel in the Southern Ocean. Argensola,
writing of the Moluccas in the sixteenth century, reports
that for ages “cries, whistles, and roarings” had been heard
from a mountain in Banda. The spot is inhabited by devils,
he concludes. Sindbad tells of an island, called Kasil, where
nightly resounds the drumbeat of rebellious djinns. So was
Prospero’s isle full of noises, but these were “sound, and sweet
airs that give delight and hurt not.”</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The Steeps Overhead Seemed Fit Abode for Giants and Dwarfs and<br>

<p>It may be that the Atlas story grew out of the habits of the
Kabyles who tenant the mountain’s recesses. During the heat
of the day they would retire to their dwellings, coming out at
night to dance about the village fires to the music of drums.
Similar legends among the Indians of South America of strange
lights seen upon the mountains appear to have a basis of fact.
Sir Martin Conway tells of a village where the bells were rung
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>and the people flocked to church in dreadful fear because, after
sunset, the peak of Illampu glowed red like fire and the end of
the world seemed at hand. In Venezuela Im Thurn beheld a
mountain strangely luminous at night. Humboldt saw a similar
spectacle in Venezuela and guessed it might be the burning
of hydrogen gases. In Colombia, Zahm saw brilliant lights
along the crest of the Cordilleras, and judged it was an electric
phenomenon, the summits acting as a vast condenser from which
electricity escaped by a silent glow or brush discharge—St.
Elmo’s fire. Here, perhaps, is the key to the Old World story.</p>

<p>The Mountains of the Moon, which lift their snowy peaks on
the line of the equator in East Africa not far from the springs
of the Nile, bear a myth-engendering name. It was given them
by Ptolemy, who perhaps translated it from native words of
the same meaning. Lying within the sphere of Arabic mediæval
geography, Eastern fable enveloped them. One story was that
whoever looked upon them was drawn to them as by a magnetic
influence and only death would release him. According to an
Arab compiler, “a certain king sent an expedition to discover
the Nile sources, and they reached the copper mountains, and
when the sun rose, the rays reflected were so strong that they
were burnt.”</p>

<p>To the early Greeks the Caucasus was the end of the world;
beyond it was naught but the Ocean Stream. Æschylus describes
it in his <i>Prometheus Bound</i> as the loftiest of mountains and
speaks of its “star-neighboring summits.” Here he pictures the
fire-stealing Titan as chained to a rock with a vulture at his
vitals. Herodotus repeats that these peaks are higher than any
other. No Roman general ever passed them. And they stood
for things dreaded and unknown—the sanguinary Amazons,
fugitive and barbaric tribes of Israel, and the sinister nations
of Gog and Magog. These are perhaps the mountains of Aaf of
Malay tradition, which run their ramparts of green chrysolite
clear about the earth and the encompassing sea.</p>

<p>The high places of American Indian tradition lay in the west.
The plains savages and some of the forest tribes looked upon the
Rocky Mountains as the boundary of the known world. These
peaks held up the sky; the spirits of the storm haunted them,
and stone giants, and huge-bellied anthropophagi. Into this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
west ran the underground trail to the land of the dead. In
South Dakota was the Hill of Little Devils, malignant pygmies
with unduly large heads, of whose arrows the prairie tribes stood
in awe.</p>

<p>There were seven sacred mountains in the land of the Navahos—four
at the cardinal points, and three at the center; and
legend gave each its own color, jewels, birds, and plants. One
mountain was fastened to the earth with a lightning flash, another
with a stone knife, another with a sunbeam, a fourth with
a rainbow. Almost in the Greek spirit the Indians of Guiana
chanted the glories of “Roraima of the red rocks, wrapped in
clouds, ever-fertile source of streams.” White jaguars and
white eagles were upon it, a magic circle surrounded it, and
demons guarded its sanctuary.</p>

<p>Whenever the Kirghiz pass by Mustaghata, loftiest of the
Pamirs, they fall upon their knees in prayer, for threescore and
ten saints live there. Sven Hedin, who made four attempts to
ascend it, repeats its legends. One story tells of a holy man
who, climbing it, found on its slopes a garden with plum trees
where old men in white garments were walking. He plucked
and ate the fruit. One of the graybeards told him it was well he
had done so, for had he despised the fruit, as they had done, it
would have been his fate to stay, as they must, walking up and
down the garden till time was no more. Then a rider on a white
horse dashed into the garden, and seizing the holy man, galloped
with him down the mountain side, leaving him in the valley,
dazed and with only a confused memory of what he had seen.
Another story tells of forty giant horsemen who swept down
the mountain and routed a Chinese army.</p>

<p>On the summit of Mustaghata, to which neither Sven Hedin,
nor the holy man, nor the graybeards could climb, the Kirghiz
say is the ancient city of Janaidar, built in a golden age when
everyone was happy and men were at peace. Its inhabitants had
no intercourse afterward with the peoples below, and all the ills
and woes of life are stranger to them. Their groves bear fruit
the year around, their flowers are unfading, their women never
grow old. Cold, darkness, and death are alike unknown to them.
The ramparts of Mustaghata are one of the seats of the realm
of eternal youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>Though its name is but the Latin word for “bald,” a grim
Swiss legend has it that Mount Pilatus is the burial place of the
Roman viceroy who surrendered Jesus to the mob. When he
took his own life, neither the Tiber nor the Rhone, into which
in succession his body was flung, would contain it. Evil and
sordid spirits raised such storms that it was carried farther. An
uncanonical book of the thirteenth century recites that it was
dropped at last “into a well surrounded by mountains, where,
according to some accounts, certain diabolic machinations and
ebullitions are still seen.” This spot was identified with a
marshy pool near the summit of Pilatus.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages it was believed that if anyone
threw a stone in this little lake, a tempest would follow. Once
a year Pilate left it and sat on a rock arrayed in scarlet. Whoever
beheld him died in a twelvemonth. The fearful burghers of
Lucerne made an ordinance that no one should approach the
pool unless one of their number went with him to see that he
cast no stone. At length, in 1585, Johann Mueller, state pastor
of Lucerne, climbed the mountain with a party of friends, flung
stones into the water, and derisively challenged the evil spirit
to come forth. Nothing happened, and the legend lapsed.</p>


<p class="large"><i>In the Desert</i></p>

<p>The desert holds the green surprise of the oases, the promise
of mysteries beyond its veil, and, as men have thought, the memory
of wonderful things that were. Tradition broods over it,
legends of caravans that never came back, of armies swallowed
up in its silences, of vast cities buried in the sand. Where there
is so little for the eye to see, the most haunting things are those
the ear has heard—music that steals from the under edges of the
dunes; voices, mocking or beguiling, which call to caravan
stragglers; the crash of ghostly drums and the clash of arms
heard afar.</p>

<p>Any survey of the deserts of history reveals the stuff of wonder.
There each man’s hand is turned against his brother, and
yet in every tent all are safe; masked tribesmen roam the waste;
stealthy slave columns cross it by abandoned routes; hereditary
clans of dancing girls supply the streets of women in the environing
lands; hermits wither in rocky cells and militant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
fanatics range the plateaus; the bustard and the wild camel show
along the uncertain skyline, and remnants of forgotten peoples
rove below it. These are momentous details; legend has done
much with less to work upon. It needs only that thirsty wayfarers
shall have, as sometimes they do, the sudden vision of
lakes of water shimmering in the distance, with palms fringing
them and temples mirrored in them. Realities of an instant
only, their passing leaves a sense of wonder that expects, and
invents.</p>

<p>Much of the tradition of the waste places has been set down
by Marco the Venetian in his account of the passage of the desert
of Lop. It is asserted as a well-known fact, he recites, that here
is the abode of evil spirits “which amuse travelers to their
destruction with most extraordinary illusions.” During the daytime,
if men fall behind the caravan, or are overtaken by sleep
so that the column has passed a hill and is out of sight, they hear
voices calling their names in tones to which they are accustomed.
Following these, they are lured from the direct road and perish
alone. At night men seem to hear the march of a large cavalcade
on one side or the other of the road. Again they follow,
in the belief that the camel bells are of their own party; the daybreak
finds them pursuing strange paths alone. Day or night,
evil spirits take the shape of their companions and seek to decoy
them from the proper route. Ghostly bodies of armed men
seem to rush upon them, and in the terror of flight they lose
the way.</p>

<p>“Marvelous indeed,” concludes Marco, “and almost passing
belief are the stories related of these spirits of the desert, which
are said at times to fill the air with the sounds of all kinds of
musical instruments, and also of drums and the clash of arms,
obliging the travelers to close their line of march and to proceed
in more compact order.”</p>

<p>This is such a recital as one would rather have expected concerning
the desert of ancient Egypt. There were the graves of
the dead, and report had it that their spirits, doomed to a miserable
existence in an inhospitable land, developed into predatory
demons who meant no good to the traveler.</p>

<p>Stories still current in Asia, however, have the flavor of
Marco’s report of seven centuries ago. Doughty tells of the fantasy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>they have at Teyma of a neighboring spectral oasis, often
beheld by the Bedouins. Slaves and horses issue from the enchanted
appearance of palms; “but all fadeth soon if a man
approach them.”</p>

<p>In the little desert of Reig Rawan at the foot of the heights
of Kohistan the wind-blown sands sweep through the rocky fissures
with a sound that is like the music of an æolian harp
accompanied by the distant beating of drums. These wild harmonies
of the wind in open spaces are the source of many
strange tales. In Reig Rawan they are fabled to be the martial
strains of armies which have been swallowed up in the sands,
but march on to unknown destinies.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Prester John has been mapped in Asia, in
Africa, and in the imagination of men. In the latter domain
lies the Gravelly Sea, a desert phenomenon which Maundeville
describes: “It is all Gravel and Sand, without any Drop of
Water, and it ebbeth and floweth in great waves as other Seas do,
and it is never still nor at Peace, in any Manner of Season. And
no Man may pass that Sea by Ship, nor by any Manner of Craft,
and therefore may no Man know what Land is beyond that Sea.
And albeit that it have no Water, yet Men find therein and on
the Banks full good Fishes of other Manner of Nature and
Shape, than Men find in any other Sea, and they be of right
good Taste and delicious for Man’s Meat.”</p>

<p>What lies beyond it? Mezzoramia, it may be, if it is accepted
that Prester John was an Abyssinian. This is an earthly paradise,
situated somewhere in Africa. Only one road leads to it,
and the road is hard to find and easy to lose again. No man
ever found this secret highway save Gaudentio di Lucca. He
traveled it to its end, and for twenty years lived behind the desert’s
curtains in a country of every felicity.</p>

<p>Fables of the waste tell of cities on which some sudden curse
has fallen and turned their people into stone. The sand has not
covered them with the decent pity of its mantle. They lie open
to the air. The sunshine falls on their silent market places and
only the wind wanders in their streets. The stony figures of the
men and women that once lived there stand where the curse had
found them, disquieting things in their semblance to statuary
and their ancient caricature of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>The map on which Anthony Jenkinson recorded his travels in
Tartary makes note of a petrified city in the plains of Central
Asia. Garcilasso de la Vega, Inca historian, tells a like tale
of petrification based on a numerous group of stone images.
The Museum Metallicum of Aldrovandi pictures an assemblage
of men, sheep, and camels converted into stone. The Arabs
have a story of a petrified camp at Hamam Meskouteen in Numidia,
where they assert that stony tents are pitched and stony
sheep dot the plain. Most circumstantial of all such legends is
that of Ras Sem, an extensive petrified village in the Cyrenaica.
It was surmised that this might be the region of the Gorgons
of classic story, whose frightful glance turned everything into
stone.</p>

<p>This village figures in old travel books, one of them dating
as far back as 1594, and Sir Kenelm Digby may have had
access to these when he printed in the <i>Mercurius Politicus</i> his
travel tale of a petrified city in northern Africa. The Tripolitan
ambassador in London asserted that a thousand persons
had seen the wonders of Ras Sem. It was a large town of
circular outline, with streets and shops and a central palace.</p>

<p>The olive and the palm stood in the courtyards, but the trees
had been turned into a cinder-colored stone. There were men
also in different postures. Some were plying their trade and
occupations in the bazaars or holding fabrics and breadstuffs in
their hands, as if to attract the passer-by. There were women
suckling their children or kneeling at the kneading trough. In
the palace a man was lying on a bed of state, and guards armed
with pike and spear stood at the door. The tenants of the palace,
and the men and women without—they, too, were of the
same bluish stone. The heads of some were wanting and others
of the Silent People had lost a leg or an arm.</p>

<p>There were camels, oxen, asses, horses, and sheep in the market
place, there were large birds perched on the walls, and in
the houses there were dogs, cats, and even mice—and all these,
like their masters and hosts, were petrified. The pieces of
money which had been brought thence were “of the bigness of
an English shilling, charged with a horse’s head on one side
and with some unknown characters on the other.”</p>

<p>The quotation is from Shaw’s <i>Travels in Barbary</i>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
writer tells of an inquiry into these stories by order of the French
court made some time before by M. Le Maire, consul at Tripoli.
The Turkish janizaries who gathered the tribute would not bring
him the body of an adult person from Ras Sem, alleging it
would be cumbersome to carry. But for a thousand dollars they
did bring the body of a little child. They declared they had run
the risk of being strangled by their companions for having delivered
to an infidel the mortal remains of one of their unfortunate
Mohammedan brethren, as they deemed these people to be.
What they brought was the statue of a small Cupid taken from
the ruins of Leptus.</p>

<p>The consul sent other persons, but none could find a trace of
walls, buildings, animals, or utensils where Ras Sem was said
to be. They did find one thing he could not explain. This was
what seemed to be tiny loaves of petrified bread; but Shaw declares
these were fossil echinites of the discoid kind. Little
pools of “heavy and ponderous water” were also come upon,
which the wind had uncovered. This, continues Shaw, “may be
the petrifying fluid which has contributed to the conversion of
the palm trees into stone.” He thinks the country of the Gorgons
was farther west.</p>

<p>From any one of several causes the fable of stony cities might
arise. While sand does not petrify, it does preserve; and sometimes,
with the winds for its artisans, it has wrought its own
architecture and sculpture in the living rock, repeating in the
infinite chances of its labors the outlines of minarets and templed
columns, and other contours in which fantasy may find the
forms of bygone worshipers. There seem to have been cases
where peoples of a higher culture have built their cities in the
desert, and have passed; and a ruder race, coming later upon the
scene, mistook their statuary for the breathing handiwork of
nature stricken into stillness and stone.</p>

<p>The typical desert legends are of splendid cities that the sands
have covered. There is truth under them, as there are ruins
under the sand; how much truth and how many ruins is a secret
the desert yields but grudgingly. In a series of striking passages
the Jewish Scriptures have sketched these dead capitals of the
waste with their jackal tenants. The Arab deems them the home
of evil spirits and hastens by. The nomads of Central Asia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
speak of opulent cities which sandstorms have blotted out in a
night and of treasure to be found in them if one digs for it under
a fortunate star. But there are unearthly chances to be faced,
and treasure-seekers will not invite them by venturing many
days’ march from the desert’s rim. One legend tells of the vanished
city of Ho-lao-lo-kia and the princes who came from many
lands to excavate the site. “But every time they try to dig the
sand away a violent wind arises, setting up whirlwinds of smoke
and a thick mist, which sweeps away the path and leads the
workmen astray into the desert.”</p>

<p>A passage from an antique Indian script, describing a city
which perished two thousand years ago, may stand for a silhouette
of the buried cities of Iran and of Turkestan, as legend
has pictured them: “The temples and the palaces of Anuradhapura
are numberless, and their golden cupolas and pavilions
shimmer in the sun. In the streets are crowds of soldiers armed
with bows and arrows. Elephants, horses, chariots, and countless
multitudes pass in a continual turmoil. There are jugglers,
dancers, and musicians from many lands, whose timbals gleam
with golden ornaments.”</p>

<p>It is more than conjecture that in these ancient lands not only
cities but states have disappeared under the sand. Gradually
they have yielded to their fate, as the desert has moved upon
them through periodic cycles of deficient rainfall. It may be
that sometimes destruction came with almost its fabled swiftness.
MacGregor saw the sands in the very act of billowing
over the walls and rolling through the streets of the Persian
town of Yazd. Much may have happened, must have happened,
in forgotten times in the great space of fifteen hundred miles
of longitude and four hundred miles of latitude comprised in
the Lop basin; and many and circumstantial are the legends
thereof.</p>

<p>In the Gobi Desert Sven Hedin discovered one of these buried
cities—God-accursed he calls it—over which the wind had flung
the sands, only to sweep them away and leave the site bare to
the sun after uncounted centuries had passed. Its walls had
once been washed by a powerful stream along which millstones
turned under the shade of luxuriant groves. There were apricot
trees in the gardens, and mulberry trees where the silkworm fed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
and spun its cocoon. There were bazaars loud with the tumult
of craftsmen. This was the city of Takla-makan.</p>

<p>What the explorer found was a dead forest, and ruins several
miles across. The timbers of hundreds of houses were still
standing, chalk-white poplar wood brittle as glass. Among them
were fragments of images in gypsum, showing the Buddha and
praying women with faces of the Aryan type, all executed with
refinement of taste; and there were even figures of boats rocking
on the waves of vanished seas.</p>

<p>“At what period,” asks its discoverer, “was this mysterious
city inhabited? When did its last crop of russet apricots ripen
in the sun? When did the sour green leaves of its poplars yellow
for their last fall? When was the trickling hum of its millwheels
silenced forever? When did its despairing people finally
abandon their dwellings to the ravenous maw of the desert king?
Who were the people who lived here? What was the tongue
they spoke? Whence came the unknown inhabitants of this
Tadmor in the wilderness? How long did their city flourish,
and whither did they go when they saw that within its walls they
could no longer have a safe abiding place?”</p>

<p>Passing the ruins of other cities, the nomad has asked himself
these and stranger questions. And out of the answers which his
superstition and fancy have suggested has been woven the myth
of the desert.</p>


<p class="large"><i>In the Forest</i></p>

<p>Men can lose their way in the deep forest, easily become confused
there, and make it a proverb that friends are not to be
met in a wood. There races that have passed out of the primitive
culture do not feel at home. Through successive stages of
their history the forest was held to be sacred, then enchanted,
then ill-omened and haunted.</p>

<p>In the beginning men worshiped trees and groves. Pan, with
his attendant fauns and satyrs, presided in the forest. The
hamadryads lived in trees, and died with them; and they might
contract marriages with mortal youths. Sometimes the tree had
its own soul, sometimes it was possessed by a spirit which had
entered it, sometimes it was the symbol, sometimes the sanctuary,
of a god. Deity dwelt in the oak of Dodona. Diana in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Autun was a midday demon of the forests and crossroads. In
the tabooed grove near Marseilles the trees were stained with
sacrificial blood, the flames burned without consuming the boscage,
and even the priests dared not venture there at midnight
or midday. The sacred bo tree is still worshiped in India. The
mistletoe is magical above all other objects. Savages hang offerings
upon trees, and in the same spirit the gypsy spits when
he passes under them.</p>

<p>The wood spirits of the primitive mythologies became at
length the stuff of folklore and travel tale—degenerate Pans and
dryads that wanderers saw sometimes in the shadows of trees.
The Old Man of the Woods, lame, hairy, green-eyed, ranges
many countries and is most clearly pictured in the tales of the
Brazilian Indians and the eastern Slavs. A mocker, misleader,
and seducer, he cast a spell of terror upon the forest. In the
wild women of Russian story it had still other perturbing tenants.
These were good-looking creatures with shaggy bodies,
square heads, and long hair. Sometimes they came into the
villages to borrow kneading troughs, but it was dangerous to
meet them in their own domain, for they turned the solitary intruder
round and round until he lost his way. They were fond
of music and might invite lads and lasses to dance with them;
whistling, however, they could not endure. Polish tales picture
them as tall, thin-faced, sensual females, with disheveled hair
and garments in constant disarray. When groups of them encountered
human beings they tickled the adults to death and took
the youths with them for their lovers; wherefore young people
never went singly to the woods. In Swedish tradition this was
the terrible Skogfrau, or Woman of the Thicket.</p>

<p>These beings personified the mystery of forest shadows and
what Ruskin called the mediæval dread of thick foliage. “Forest
in every semicivilized land,” says Belloc, “is ever a word
of fear.” There the knights of old tale had adventure with
giants and dwarfs and spell-weaving witches, and there the
younger sons of folklore followed lonely paths with beasts and
birds to counsel them. As the enchanted woods of romance with
their goblin glooms and talking trees faded from the minds of
men, in their place appeared the real terrors of thickets where
robbers, banished men, and fugitive peoples beset the ways with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>danger. The conception of forests as sanctuaries of peace is
modern.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The Enchanted Woods of Romance with Their Goblin Glooms and Talking<br>
Trees Faded from the Minds of Men</i></p>
</div>


<p class="large"><i>Under the Ground</i></p>

<p>The cellar strain that is in human nature betrays itself in the
satisfaction men take in roaring songs and drinking bitter
liquors in rat-haunted sunken spaces. If groves were God’s first
temples, grottoes were men’s first dwellings. They came out of
caves, and in flight sometimes they return to them. For their
extremity mother earth has provided a rocky roof, a bedchamber,
a storeroom, and a fireplace. Wherefore they deem no
habitation complete until they have dug a cave under it.</p>

<p>“Men,” said the Caribs, “should avoid places which are enlightened
neither by the sun nor by the moon.” Yet there are
races whose legends have dug a cellar under the entire earth;
if its surface is the floor of one world, it is the roof of another.
Beneath it are the happy hunting grounds of the Indian. According
to Cherokee myth the living can descend thereto if, after
fasting, they follow back the streams to their springs and have
one of the underground folk to guide them, for the springs are
doorways to the world below. There one finds people, animals,
and plants about as they are above, but the seasons are different,
for are not the springs warmer than the air in winter, and cooler
in summer? Navaho legend makes the surface of the earth the
top story of a structure five stories high. Beginning as ants,
beetles, dragonflies, locusts, and bats, mankind climbed from
one story to another, or rather was expelled from each, usually
for sexual sin.</p>

<p>The gods’ land, or Elysium, of the Celts was commonly placed
upon far islands of the west, but sometimes in the hollow hills
called Sid. Here were fair meadows and stately palaces and
musical trees and a beautiful people whose berry diet kept them
ever young; in the song of the magic birds of this underworld
there were seven years of joy and oblivion. These people were
the Tuatha Dé Danann. Giraldus Cambrensis describes a like
people, but of fairy stature, dwelling underground, swearing no
oaths, forswearing human ambition and inconstancy, and subsisting
on milk and saffron. Yet the Nagas of Hindoo story and
the gnomes of European folk-tale may be true historical races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>With his keen sense of an earthly origin primitive man was
deeply interested in burrowing creatures—in the scarab with his
little round ball that symbolized the sun in Egypt; in the beetle
of the South American pampas, which symbolized the Creator;
in the rats and mice which various tribes worshiped; in the runway
of the armadillo which in Brazil was an entrance to the
land of shades; in the tunnel of the mole, and the cities of the
marmot. This underground world of tiny animals figures large
in the folklore of early peoples, shaping their genealogies, influencing
their councils, intervening in their affairs for good and
ill, at times deciding their destinies.</p>

<p>There was sorcery underground. Life came from it with
each recurring spring. The dead were laid there, and far beneath
were the abodes of their spirits. In the caverns were
witches who had some command over life and death. There
also were the haunts of necromancers, and though their dens
were squalid, all the riches of the world were around them.
Legend became sumptuous and prodigal when it left the surface
of the earth and plunged into the darkness under it.</p>

<p>The story of Aladdin’s descent into this realm carries nearly
all the elements of subterranean myth. His false uncle, the
African magician, conducted him to a valley between mountains
near a large Chinese town. When he muttered a spell the
earth opened, and the lad went down a stone staircase into a
palace where were brazen cisterns brimming with gold and silver.
Beyond in a terraced garden was a magic lamp. Securing
the latter and starting back, the youth paused to look at the
fruits that hung from trees in the garden. These were of various
hues, and though he did not know it, they were precious stones.
Aladdin would have wished they were figs or grapes or pomegranates;
but he filled his purse with them and crammed them
in his bosom.</p>

<p>Because the youth was slow in passing up the lamp, the magician
who was waiting without lowered the stone over the staircase,
and Aladdin was left in darkness. But a genie of frightful
aspect appeared when he chanced to rub a ring his false
uncle had given him. The apparition was a slave of the ring,
and with it began the cycle of deeds and gifts that won the Chinese
gamin a princess and a throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>One element is missing in this descent, type otherwise of a
thousand others. That is women. There were beautiful enchantresses
as well as foul witches under the ground. They
figure in a characteristic story of India told by Hiouen Thsiang.
A good-natured fellow, versed in magic formulas, entered a
cavern with thirteen companions. They came to a walled city
with towers and lookouts of gold, silver, and lapis-lazuli.
Young, laughing maidens greeted them at the outer gates, and
at the inner gates were two slave girls each holding a golden vessel
full of flowers and scents. Before the men went farther, these
told them they must bathe in the tank that stood there, anoint
themselves with perfumes, and crown themselves with flowers.
But they must wait awhile before they bathed; only the master
of magic could immerse at once. Of course the thirteen ignored
the warning, and when they entered the tank they became confused.
They were found afterward, says the Chinese author,
“sitting in the middle of a rice-field distant from this due north,
over a level country, about thirty or forty li,” with no recollection
of how they got there.</p>

<p>The sorceress and enchantress motives are developed into
drama in the great myth of Tannhäuser. This minnesinger of
the Middle Ages was riding through the dusk toward Wartburg,
where minstrels were to compete for a prize, when he saw a
glimmering figure on the slopes of the mountain called the
Hörselberg. White arms were stretched to him in the gesture
that is always more eloquent than words, and, leaving his
charger, he followed the woman. Flowers bloomed in her footsteps,
nymphs attended her, and a rosy light lay on the path as
she led the knight to a cavern’s mouth and thence to her palace
in the heart of the mountain. There for seven years he was
the willing slave of the pagan Goddess of Love, and partner
in the revels of her court.</p>

<p>Satiety and an awakened conscience came together. The minstrel
longed for a breath of pure mountain air, for the tinkle
of sheep bells, for the sky of night and its stars. When Venus
would not release her thrall, he spoke the Virgin’s name—and
the mountain-side opened. He found himself again aboveground
and heard the chime of church bells.</p>

<p>To one priest after another Tannhäuser made confession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
his great sin, but the shocked clerics dared not give him absolution,
and at length he stood before the Pope.</p>

<p>“Sooner shall this staff in my hand grow green and blossom,”
said the stern vicar of Heaven, “than that God should pardon
thee.” With darkness in his soul, Tannhäuser turned away.
Three days afterward the papal staff put forth buds and blossoms,
and messengers were sent in haste from Rome. They
reached the Hörselberg only to learn that a haggard wayfarer
had just entered the mountain. The minstrel was never seen
again.</p>

<p>The golden age will issue from underground, according to a
noble legend of the mediæval time which concerns Frederick
Barbarossa, head of the Holy Roman Empire. He was not
drowned in Cilicia while on crusade, as report had it. He is
sleeping in a cavernous chamber in the Kyffhäuser Berg which
rises from the emerald meadows of Thuringia. His long red
beard has grown quite through the stone table where he sits in
slumber. The good knights surround him, and once in a hundred
years he rouses himself and asks if the ravens still fly
around the mountain. When the birds of omen no longer call
about the steeps he shall awake and sally forth with his horsemen,
and the peace of all men shall follow.</p>

<p>Thus at times has legend walked the earth, as men might cross
the flat housetops of an Eastern city, with the thought that what
counted most was just beneath its immense roof.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Darkness</i></p>

<p>The dark has other creatures besides the bat and owl, other
spectacles than those that pass in dreams. Sometimes in Celtic
legend a mist descended on a man, and until it lifted the towers
and orchards of elysium were all about him. There is a class of
Eastern legends which tell of men around whom a sudden
shadow fell, so that they were seen no more, or next were seen
in another place. Maundeville has a tale of a cloud which settled
down upon a land and did not lift again. This was a
province called Hanyson in the kingdom of Abchaz which is
next to the kingdom of Georgia. One must travel three days to
ride around the province, and one dare not ride through it, for
thick twilight covers it. Out of the gloom the people of neighboring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
lands hear voices of folk, and horses neighing, and cocks
crowing.</p>

<p>The story is that a cursed emperor of Persia that was hight
Saures overtook a Christian host in the plain that was hight
Megon and would have destroyed it. “But anon a thick Cloud
came and covered the Emperor and all his Host. And so they
endure in that Manner that they must not go out on any Side;
and so shall they evermore abide in Darkness till the Day of
Doom, by the Miracle of God. And then the Christian Men
went where liked them best. Also ye shall understand that out
of that Land of Darkness goeth out a great River that sheweth
well that there be Folk dwelling there by many Tokens; but no
Man dare enter into it.”</p>

<p>Some report of the long Arctic night reached the Asiatic countries
of lower latitudes, and Marco Polo when he traversed them.
He gives a hearsay account of what he calls the Region of Darkness.
It is distant fourteen journeys by dog-sled across the tundras
from the country of the Tartars. The atmosphere in this
twilight land is “as we find it just about the dawn of day, when
we may be said to see and not to see.” Its people are tall and
well made, but pale, stupid, and brutish, and without prince or
other governance. They have great stores of furs of ermines,
martins, and foxes. Under cover of the prevailing darkness
the Tartars raid them, plundering them of their furs and driving
off their cattle. That they may not become lost forever in
the gloom, the raiders ride mares that have young foals, and
these are left on the frontiers. When the Tartars would return,
they lay the bridles on the necks of the dams, and maternal instinct
finds the homeward track.</p>

<p>Fable and fact ride abreast through this narrative, as horsemen
through the chill obscurity of dawn, and a great thing has
come of it. Marco’s account of the peltry of the north had more
to do than aught else, tradition says, with the founding of the
Hudson Bay Company and the opening of the northern half of
the American continent.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Distance</i></p>

<p>The haze on all these horizon lands is the haze of distance.
There are two phrases which come to the ear with the sound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
unlocking doors. One is Once upon a Time, which children
hear; it is distance measured in years. The other is Beyond
the Mountains, which plainsmen use; it is distance measured in
miles and difficulties. For either distance, fetters fall.</p>

<p>Three tales may declare this as well as a thousand, and a
thousand might be told. Russian peasants speak of a land which
they call Bielovodye, and which lies, as they think, somewhere
on the borders of Mongolia in the distant east. It is a country
of peace and plenty, and nobody lives there.</p>

<p>Rubruquis gives just a glimpse, as of something seen afar
through a narrow window. “A Chinese priest,” he says, “told
me also for truth (which neverthelesse, I doe not believe) that
there is a province beyond Cataia, into the which, at whatsoever
age a man enters, he continueth in the same age wherein he
entred.”</p>

<p>The widest horizons of time and space are reached in a single
artless sentence in a gypsy folk tale: “They went then further
than I can remember, till they reached the knoll of the country
at the back of the wind and the face of the sun, that was in
the realm of Big Women.” The men who made this journey
skirted all the coasts of illusion.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">There</span> are countries whose boundaries have not been fixed
by armies or treaties, nor their ways marked out by trade. The
dreams of men have made them. Their substance is reality, yet
their effect is vision. By a sort of conspiracy of wish, to which
men of imaginative mind have been parties and all others have
yielded assent, these countries have been supposed to be different
from what any was or could be. It has been easy enough
to create the illusion, for one’s view of another land is always
more or less a symbolic drawing.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Ophir</i></p>

<p>The geographical table in the tenth chapter of Genesis tells
a straight tale which men debated for something more than two
thousand years and only in the present century have accepted
at its face value. In one phrase the Scriptures link Ophir and
Havilah, and then add that “their dwelling was from Mesha, as
thou goest unto Sephar, a mount of the East.” Where was
Ophir? Perhaps the learned men of Alexandria were the first
to ask the question. What was Ophir? This question nobody
thought of putting, and it was vital.</p>

<p>Ophir was a magic word which let no man rest once he had
heard it. The spell of gold was in it. Even as they wrote, it
seemed to intoxicate the Jewish prophets, poets, and chroniclers.
Isaiah speaks of the “golden wedge of Ophir.” It is said of wisdom
in the Book of Job that it cannot be valued with the gold
of Ophir, with the precious onyx or the sapphire. “Then shalt
thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones
of the brooks,” says another passage Oriental in its opulence
of suggestion.</p>

<p>From Ophir came the fleet of Solomon and Hiram of Tyre,
fetching gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and sandalwood.
The arrival of the treasure fleet is associated in the narrative,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
for some reason one may only guess, with the coming to Jerusalem
of the Queen of Sheba. The two incidents constitute the
most gorgeous episode in Jewish history.</p>

<p>Sheba’s queen comes to visit Solomon with a very great train,
with camels that bear spices, and very much gold and precious
stones. She sees the meat of his table, the sitting of his servants,
and the attendance of his ministers. She proves him with
hard questions, and pride dies in her. The report she has heard
in her own land of his wealth and wisdom was a true report, she
declares, but the half had not been told. Then she goes back,
and her camels take across the deserts gifts richer than they had
brought. Gold of Ophir travels north, and south again, and
legend follows it.</p>

<p>Two other place-names appear on this piece of Hebrew brocade.
One is Ezion-geber, Solomon’s port on the Red Sea in
the land of Edom. The other is Tharshish, where the king had
ships. Once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing
gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks. There was nothing
in these imports that one might eat or drink or use for shelter
or raiment. The commodities were typical of ancient commerce
in their magnificence, their vain show, and their uselessness—and
the cargo has freighted the imagination of men ever since.
There was contraband in the ships of Tharshish. Among the
elephants’ teeth and peacocks was stowed away the spirit of the
East.</p>

<p>Where was Tharshish? Where was Ophir? Where was Havilah,
mentioned rarely, but in a significant context?</p>

<p>It was long thought that Tharshish was the Carthaginian port
of Tartessus beyond the Pillars, where now is the Spanish port
of Cadiz. But Spain had few apes, little gold, and no ivory.
The text of Genesis seemed to point to the Arabian coast as the
seat of Ophir. But Araby had no elephants and its gold came
from elsewhere. Ophir was sought also in the African spiceland
of Punt, in the Midian country of northern Arabia, and at
the mouth of the Indus in Hindostan. Once in every three years
came the fleet, so said the text; and into this was read the meaning,
not of periodic sailings, but of voyages that covered three
years. Ophir, therefore, must lie in the far East, and men
sought it in the Malay Peninsula, in that Golden Chersonese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
where were ivory and apes and peacocks, as well as precious
metals.</p>

<p>For one splendid century it was Portugese instinct to advance
steadily, to see clearly, and to do great things easily—the legacy,
perhaps, of that incomparable spirit, Prince Henry the Navigator.
Within the century after his death, his countrymen had
gone around Africa, opened a sea route to the Indies, and made
the coveted Spice Islands their own. Also, they had discovered
Ophir, or rather almost discovered it. What they found was
the missing port of Tharshish, and Havilah, the land which
scriptural writers linked with Ophir, and dismissed.</p>

<p>A Portugese squadron, outbound for the Indies in 1505, put
in at the little African port of Sofala on the Mozambique Channel,
looking east toward Madagascar. Learning that the Arabs,
or Moors, as they called them, were trafficking here for gold
brought down to the coast from the interior, its captains said that
this must be Ophir. It has taken four centuries to show how
near this casual judgment was to the truth. The gold of Ophir
reached the Indian Ocean through the African port once named
Tharshish and now called Sofala, and came from the Mashona
and Matabele region between the lower Zambesi and the Limpopo
rivers in what is now Rhodesia. It was Hottentot gold,
not gold of Araby.</p>

<p>What was Ophir? When at length this question was asked,
the Scripture texts, which pointed eastward toward Arabian regions
where gold was not, slowly yielded their paradox. Ophir
was not a country at all. It was a port, perhaps the greatest of
the ancient world. Here the products of India, of Africa, and
of the Eastern Mediterranean were interchanged. The gold of
ancient Rhodesia (Havilah) became gold of Ophir, just as figs
of the Levant become Smyrna figs and the white grapes of Spain
become Malaga grapes, when freighted on ships outbound from
those ports.</p>

<p>In the days of its decline Ophir was known to Ptolemy, the
Alexandrian geographer, as the Sapphar Metropolis; to Arrian,
the Greek geographer, as Portus Nobilis, and to the Romans as
Moscha. It lay where Genesis places it: “and their dwelling
was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the
east.” There, under the shadow of Mount Sephar, nearly opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
the island of Socotra and about midway along the southern
coast of Arabia, its ruins lie around a silted inlet of the sea.
Mesha, or Moscha, signifies a wharf or landing place, and was
at the inlet’s mouth. Ophir stood at the head of the inlet. The
name signifies simply The City, The Metropolis, as the Roman
used the single word <i>urbs</i> to designate his capital.</p>

<p>This was the great mart of Himyaritic civilization. The
Himyarites were the settled folk of southern Arabia—the
Minæans and their successors, the Sabæans. It may be that their
civilization was the earliest in the world, still older than the
Egyptian and Chaldean. There is reason to believe that the
carrying trade of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean was in their
hands for a greater part of the period during which it has been
assumed that the Phœnicians controlled it. The merchants of
Tyre and Sidon were brief interlopers in a sea-borne commerce
which for thousands of years had been the monopoly of the
Sabæan Arabs. That the latter worked the mines of ancient
Rhodesia in the land they called Havilah is the simple and unavoidable
inference from facts which nevertheless required
about a generation of archæological research to establish, and
which the geographer, A. H. Keane, has summarized in his striking
monograph. The Himyaritic inscriptions in southern
Arabia and the inscriptions on the extensive ruins of ancient
gold workings between the Zambesi and the Limpopo were made
by the same people.</p>

<p>The going of Solomon’s ships and the ships of his Tyrian ally
to Ophir and on to Tharshish, and the coming of Sabæa’s queen
to Jerusalem, were what they are represented to be, brilliant
and exotic incidents in the troubled march of Jewish history.
This traffic covered only about a century, and millenniums of
Arab commerce between Ophir and Tharshish envelop it. After
that century Israel and Phœnicia disappear from the Indian
Ocean, and the South Arab takes up the gold trade anew. At
this task the Portuguese found him.</p>

<p>The Jew was the prosperous visitor of an hour at the port of
the Sabæans. Perhaps their queen made a return call to learn
why he had come and whence the gold in his wallet. The answer
was not in Solomon himself; truly, indeed, the half was never
told her. It was David whose conquest of Edom had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
Israel temporary control of important trade routes. The wealth
of Solomon was in part a transportation charge, and in part a
police tax upon “the traffick of the spice merchants and all the
kings of Arabia.” They paid it rather than have their caravans
plundered on the roads the Jew controlled. The gold that
Israel and Phœnicia brought from Tharshish direct, like the gold
which Spain brought from Peru, was not obtained in trade exchanges.
It was wrung from slave labor, Hottentots and Bushmen—whose
present physiognomy and complexion show an Asiatic
strain—toiling for taskmasters, as since they have toiled,
under the sjambok.</p>

<p>Ezion-geber, the Jewish port, lay at the head of the Red Sea.
Tharshish lay nearly six thousand miles to the south as coasting
vessels made it, and voyages were probably by way of some
port in the west of Madagascar, where Semitic influences have
been discovered. Midway between Tharshish and Ezion-geber,
and midway between the east and west of antiquity, lay Ophir.
The age-long vision of a golden land lifts from its name. In its
stead loom the shadowy outlines of a mighty port, with strange
ships at anchor, and clinking bags and odorous bales upon the
wharves, and hawk-faced merchants at their traffic, where now
are ruins and the oblivious sea.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Lotus-land</i></p>

<p>The country of the lotus-eaters was a promontory jutting out
into the Mediterranean Sea from the land of the Gindanes.
Whoso tastes the fruit of the lotus, Homer said, forgets his native
shore, his family, and his friends. In an age that avows
a world-weariness to which the wandering Greeks were strangers,
this brief glimpse of a land released from remembrance
has been an arresting thing.</p>

<p>Later poets expanded the Odyssey legend, wrote new significances
into it, and sometimes provided it with a different ending,
as in the fine poem of Tennyson. The Victorian gives no
hint that the companions of Ulysses fled from Lotus-land. It
seemed to them better to stay there. They had traveled unto
fatigue, and their island homes were still far beyond the wave.
Dear as were the last embraces of their wives, it was likely that
themselves were now all but forgotten, that their sons had inherited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
them, and that their deeds before Troy were sung by
minstrels as things of long ago. Why return like ghosts to trouble
joy? So the mariners burst into choric song declaring the
delights of long rest and dreamful ease and mild-minded melancholy
upon a slumbrous shore. Then the rhythm changes to
carry their resolve:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We have had enough of action, and of motion we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rolled to starboard, rolled to larboard, when the surge was seething free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In the Homeric story the lotus strand was a halting place for
Ulysses and his men on the way from the Ciconian coast to their
adventure with the giant Polyphemus. Their momentary pause
in the enchanted Libyan land is the slightest episode in the
Odyssey. After nine days of stormy faring they anchor by a
fragrant beach and go ashore for water and a feast. Three of
their number wander farther and hospitable natives bid them
eat the fruit of their trees. Having eaten, a spell of oblivion
falls on them and they would travel no more; but their comrades
bind them and carry them aboard the ships, and hastily
the company sails away.</p>

<p>Herodotus locates the land of the lotus-eaters in the Syrtic
district of the North African coast, whence a caravan route leads
to Egypt. This people, he says, live entirely on the fruit of the
lotus tree. The fruit is about the size of the lentisk berry, and
in sweetness resembles the date. The lotophagi even succeed in
obtaining from it a sort of wine. Rawlinson, who identifies the
lotus with the rhamnus, asserts, however, that it looks and tastes
“rather like a bad crab apple.”</p>

<p>There has been controversy as to what the ancients meant by
the lotus. Some writers said it was a kind of clover, the poa of
Strabo. The lotus of Egypt and India is a water lily whose
roots and seeds are eaten by the poor. Pliny says that the lotus
of Homer was a tree “the size of a pear tree, though Cornelius
Nepos calls it low.” The latter describes its fruit as yellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
the size of a bean, and sweet and pleasant to the taste. It was
pounded into a paste and stored for food, and a wine like mead
was made from it. In the district where Ulysses anchored, and
which has been identified with the modern Jerba, the tree still
flourishes; Arabs eat its fruit and make a wine of it. Its commercial
name is jujube, and in the Mediterranean countries it
is prized as a winter dessert fruit.</p>

<p>If there were poppy dreams in the orchards of Africa, the
secret of them passed with the wine the ancients brewed there.
The longing for forgetfulness remains. Those who have come
by it honestly through toil have found, as Ulysses did, that
lotus-land is a port of call upon struggling seas.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Incense Country</i></p>

<p>The world commerce of ancient times was in four commodities—gold,
amber, precious stones, and incense. With transportation
by pack, caravan, and small coasting craft, nothing
of greater bulk or less intrinsic worth could be carried far at
a profit. The first three of these commodities were come upon
more or less by accident. Incense was the root, bark, gum,
seeds, dried leaves, or flowers of various trees, shrubs, and
plants, and was gathered at stated seasons of the year. The business
had the element of certainty, so far as anything could be
certain in ages when land and water travel were pursuits of
hazard, when there was little law upon the desert and none upon
the sea. The incense trade was therefore the great trade of antiquity.
By it the nations of the east, west and south first came
to know one another.</p>

<p>How important was this traffic Pliny bears witness in his
<i>Natural History</i>. Page after page, chapter after chapter, book
after book are devoted to the incense, perfumes, and unguents
of the East. It is an impatient, although a faithful, testimony.
The Latin writer groans over the enormous prices the precious
gums command, recites how they are sophisticated in the Alexandrian
warehouses with resin, turpentine, and Cyprian wax,
lists the nine substances with which Indian nard is imitated, and
rails at the superstition which uses scents for sacrifice, the sinful
luxury which drenches the body with them, and even mingles
them in the wines of the table. Consider, he says, the vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
number of funerals celebrated every year throughout the world,
the heaps of incense piled up in honor of the dead, the quantities
offered to the gods. Is anybody the better off? It seems
to Pliny that the immortal ones were kinder to men when a
salted cake was the best they could hope to find on their altars.
At the very lowest the Indians, Seres, and Arabians took from
the empire one hundred million sesterces every year—“so
dearly do we pay for our luxury and our women.”</p>

<p>Not content with the prodigality of nature, Pliny continues,
luxury has seen fit to combine all pleasant odors into a single
whole, and hence have come unguents. The Persians quite
soak themselves in these blended perfumes, to conceal from
themselves that they live in dirt. There are Romans who go
still further, for they plaster themselves with unguents. Some
of them, and Nero of the number, even sprinkle therewith the
soles of their feet. On festival days the very eagles on battle
standards, thick with the dust of the camps, are anointed.
Pearls and jewels have a value that lasts, but scents die as
soon as they are born. To what good is this all, Pliny asks
again.</p>

<p>Few others put this question. For the living, for the dead,
and for the very gods, there must be a savor of satisfaction.
Gums were burned to purify the air of dwellings, to mask the
odors of burnt sacrifice, to disguise the intimations of mortality
when the bodies of the dead smoked on funeral pyres. Their
use to these ends was the primitive sanitary science of the
East. In the rites of embalming, their fumes reanimated
mummy and mortuary statue and nourished the souls of the
departed on the journey to the spirit-land. The gods above were
fed by the smoke of sacrifice and their favor was flattered
for the projects of men. So it befell in Egypt, and the pages of
Herodotus are in evidence that the whole country had become
a vast drug shop.</p>

<p>Musk came from the highlands of China, and from India,
gum benzoin from Java, sandalwood from the Golden Chersonese,
cloves from Eastern islands unknown. Balm of Gilead,
the most precious of odoriferous substances, came from Judea,
and according to Pliny battles had been fought over it between
Jews and Romans. There were other spicy roots, leaves, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
petals that grew in desert gardens or mountain parks of the
East; the geography of scents was wide and vague and little
known. But the true incense land of the ancients had definite
bounds. It lay on both sides of the promontory known variously
as the Aromatic Cape and as the Cape of Spices and now
as Cape Guardafui, where the continent of Africa juts farthest
into the Indian Ocean. This land had two provinces—Punt,
which is the modern Somaliland, and Sabæa, which is southern
Arabia.</p>

<p>Cinnamon and cassia were taken from Punt, and some frankincense,
the “true incense,” as the name signifies and as the
Christian altars of Europe afterward came to know it. From
Sabæa were taken large quantities of frankincense, as well as
myrrh and ladanum. The latter country had credit also in the
ancient world for a long list of balms that came from elsewhere.
The secret, never more than half known, was that
Sabæa imported odorous things as well as grew them. It
brought them in from more eastern countries and sent them
forth on its ships, or on the camels that traveled the incense
route northward to Petra, whence they were dispensed to the
Mediterranean peoples. The incense land was the center of
world commerce, which was above all a traffic in sweet savors,
and the countries commanding the southern approach to the Red
Sea had the same significant relation to it that now belongs to
Suez, the northern approach to that sea.</p>

<p>The air of incense-land was as heavy with traditions as it
was reported to be with odors. The desert hemmed in both Punt
and Sabæa, and its mysteries stole in with the sands. The rites
of a dim religion were wrapped around the harvest of the
precious gums. Merchant subtleties spread afar the stories of
more than mortal perils to be met by those who entered the
places of fragrance. The effect of these fables was to enhance
prices and confirm the Arab monopoly. To the ancient world
the land of incense was an enchanting, and yet a forbidding
and a forbidden land.</p>

<p>Its enchantments were felt even at a distance. The whole
country of Arabia, says Herodotus, is scented with spices, and
exhales an odor marvelously sweet. Diodorus declares that even
before the mariner sights this coast its delights come out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
meet him upon the sea. The breezes of spring waft to him
the fragrant breath of trees and shrubs, and keener satisfactions
than he may have elsewhere, for these are no old and stored
aromatics, but fresh from new-blown flowers. Pliny is skeptical,
yet repeats the story with further detail. Under the rays
of the noonday sun, he says, the entire peninsula gives forth
an indescribable perfume, the blend of many beguiling odors.
Thus it was, while still far out, the fleet of Alexander knew it
was nearing Araby the Happy.</p>

<p>The languors of incense floated through the towns and villages
of Sabæa and enveloped its lofty capital. Timbers and
floors of the houses were of sweet-scented woods, and fagots of
frankincense and sticks of myrrh, burning in the fireplaces, gave
them a perpetual fragrance of sacrifice. To counteract these
bland but debilitating suavities the Arabians of the south
brought the gum of storax down from Syria. This they burned
in goat skins and found its pungent smell a reviving thing.</p>

<p>Saba, the country’s capital, was a dream-city of spices and
gold. From a steep which commanded the surrounding lands
its temples and palaces reared their roofs amid delightful
groves. The trade of countless centuries had drawn vast riches
to the incense metropolis. The houses of the merchants were
resplendent with precious metals and precious stones. Reclining
upon couches inlaid with silver, they drank from gem-studded
goblets of gold. The camels padding northward, and
the ships faring north, east, and south, brought back the wherewithal
to sustain a life of sensual magnificence. Chief among
the voluptuaries was the Sabæan king. From his seat of judgment
in a gorgeous palace he determined all disputes with the
authority of an absolute sovereign. Yet his own freedom of
movement was restrained by the priestly class. He was a prisoner
of the palace, and, should he venture outside its scented
courts and shaded gardens, the rabble assailed him with stones
and drove him back to them. So an oracle had prescribed.</p>

<p>Over the gathering of incense, and its coming and going in
the land of the Sabæans, priestly tradition had flung a mantle
rich in fable and somber with fear. Eight days’ journey to
the northeast from the capital, in a district a hundred miles
long by fifty miles wide, stood the sacred groves in a soil of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
milky white a little inclining to red. Thither at the time of
the rising of the Dog Star, when the heat was most intense,
went the Arabians to make incisions in the trees. The unctuous
foam which gathered on the bark was permitted to remain and
harden; nor was it removed until autumn. The gum which
assumed the form of globular drops was called male incense.
More esteemed were the pieces where two drops had adhered
into the semblance of breasts, which were called female incense.</p>

<p>By inherited right the harvest was the privilege of three thousand
families. Their persons were deemed to be holy. While
pruning the trees and gathering the gum they must receive no
pollution either by intercourse with women or by coming in
contact with the dead. They carried their produce to the capital
upon camels by an appointed road and were admitted at a single
gate. It was death to deviate from this road.</p>

<p>Various deductions were made from the camel loads to pay
for carriage, the service of the temples, the expenses of the state,
and the transportation taxes laid by other countries through
which the overland caravans were to pass. The entertainment
of strangers at the capital was provided for out of a tithe taken
from frankincense. In its journey of more than a thousand
miles northward from Saba to Petra in the land of the Nabatheans,
successive peoples, beginning with the Minæans, received
the freight and passed it on. Mecca and Medina, afterward holy
places of Islam, were stations on the incense route. It was a
drowsy traffic that went up and down this ancient road. The
suns of the desert, falling upon the bales, drew from them that
which made the carriers nod upon their beasts in a dream of
delight. They revived themselves, legend continues, by inhaling
the pungent fumes of bitumen and goat’s-beard.</p>

<p>There were other than ritual terrors in gathering frankincense
and the related substances. Herodotus heard the story
that the groves were infested by small winged serpents of the
same sort that invade Egypt. These clung to every branch, but
if one burned gum storax under the tree they were dislodged;
a like report had it that in Malabar great serpents coiled themselves
about the sandalwood trees.</p>

<p>The cinnamon and cassia which the Sabæans imported from
Punt, on the African side of the Gulf of Aden, or themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
gathered there, were harvested with difficulty and peril, and only
after the consent of the god had been given. The entrails of
forty-four oxen, goats, and rams were offered up, nothing could
be done before sunrise or after sunset, and when the harvest was
made a priest set aside the god’s portion with the point of a
spear. A third portion was devoted to the sun, and this burst
at once into flame.</p>

<p>There were great birds which collected sticks of cinnamon for
their nests, which were fastened with mud to a sheer face of
rock that foot of man could not climb. Sometimes these nests
were broken down by means of leaden arrows. Sometimes the
merchants, like the diamond-seekers in the Sindbad tale, placed
large pieces of meat on the ground, and their weight caused the
nests to fall when the mother birds bore the meat aloft to their
young. The Arabians, returning, collected the cinnamon.</p>

<p>Cassia grew on the marshy shores of a lake where were a
number of winged animals much resembling bats, which
screeched horribly and were very valiant. The Arabians covered
their bodies and faces with the hides of oxen, leaving only
holes for their eyes. While they gathered the bark they were
kept busy shielding their eyes from assault from the air.</p>

<p>There was still a long journey for these aromatic stuffs before
they reached the marts of Arabia, at least when the people of
Punt themselves made it. They put forth over vast tracts of sea
upon rafts which were neither steered by rudder nor impelled
by oar or sail. At the time of the winter equinox they went to
sea on a wind from the southeast, and when they doubled the
promontory of Arabia the northeast wind met them and took them
from gulf to gulf. They skirted shores where forests, set afire
by the heat of the sun, were blazing. It might be five years
before their rafts, laden with copper, cloths, bracelets, and necklaces,
were hauled up again on the beaches of Somaliland.</p>

<p>There may have been a memory of musk in stories told about
cassia and about ladanum. The ends of cassia branches of the
length of two fingers were cut off and sewn in fresh skins of
cattle. When the skins putrified, maggots ate away the woody
parts but left the bark, which was too bitter to invite their attack.
As to the ladanum of northern Arabia, Herodotus remarks that,
although found in a most inodorous place, it is the sweetest-scented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
of all substances. Goats gathered it. These animals
cropped the sprouting shoots of mastic branches when they were
swollen with a juice of remarkable sweetness. Drops thereof
were wiped up by their unlucky beards, and became clotted with
dust and dry from the sun. Men with shears collected it, and
that was why the Romans found goats’ hairs therein.</p>

<p>Out of such stories were framed the geography, polity, and
ritual of the land of incense. What came of them was a monopoly,
a mystery, a spell that was slow to pass. In the smoke
of altars one may almost glimpse the temples of this dim
domain, and in the tinkle of the censing bell hear the bells of
camels along an ancient path.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Gog and Magog of the North</i></p>

<p>The pastures of High Asia were the range of Gog and Magog.
The Caucasus was their prison home. Sometimes these formidable
races were pictured as roving the steppes and deserts of
the north, sometimes as swinging back and forth against the
walls of mountain valleys, where the policy of Alexander or
divine compassion for the rest of mankind had confined them.
Always they were seeking a way out, and sometime they would
find it, and the world would shudder down in ruin under their
tread.</p>

<p>These races were the nightmare vision of two thousand years.
There are words the very sound of which evokes the myths of
fear. Such are Gog and Magog, with their harsh internal echo
and inhuman suggestion. They were associated with the terrors
of Scythia, known and unknown—the incursions of dwarfish,
shrill-voiced nomads upon the civilizations of the south, the
sense of vast desolate spaces where prodigious things had their
beginning. These misgivings, made definite by biblical imagery
and by the literal statements of the Koran, grew into legends
which were enriched by contributions from classic fable and
shared by the Jewish, Christian, and Moslem worlds.</p>

<p>Magog was a son of Japheth, says Genesis. In the book of
<i>Ezekiel</i> it is declared that the Lord will bring Gog with his horses
and horsemen out of the north, and Persia, Ethiopia and Libya
with them. They shall ascend and come like a storm and like a
cloud shall cover the land. They shall think an evil thought, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
take a spoil and to take a prey. But the fury of the Lord shall
come up in His face and there shall be a great shaking in the
land of Israel. Gog shall fall upon the open field, and a fire
will be sent upon Magog and among them that dwell carelessly
in the isles. The wreckage of their shields and staves shall burn
for seven years, and Gog shall have a place of graves in Israel,
the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea.</p>

<p>The burden of prophecy is taken up anew in <i>Revelation</i>.
When the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
from his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are
in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them
together to battle. They shall compass the camp of the saints
about, and fire will come down out of heaven to devour them.</p>

<p>The Koran buttressed biblical prophecy with a historical narrative.
It concerns the journeys of Doul-Karnain, the Lord of
the Two Horns, a personage variously identified with Alexander,
Julius Cæsar and Augustus, but by the east believed to be Alexander.
When he went forth with his army he marched to the
going down of the sun and found it set in a miry fount. He
marched to the farthest east and found a people oppressed by
the heat. Then he marched north and in a valley between two
mountains he found a people who told him that Gog and Magog
laid waste their land. “Build us, O Doul-Karnain,” they
begged, “a rampart between us and them.” He bade them bring
him blocks of iron, and when he had filled the space between the
mountains, he caused them to blow upon the wall with bellows,
and heated it fiery hot, and poured molten brass upon it. Gog
and Magog could not scale it, nor were they able to dig
through it.</p>

<p>Ezekiel wrote when the memory of an invasion of Scythian
horsemen was still fresh in Asia the Less, and he drew his imagery
from it; to him, and to John after him, Gog and Magog
were symbols of earthly power opposed to Jehovah. But the
Semitic world, Jew and Arab alike, scanned the vigorous picture
of a nation from the steppes riding over the world, and saw in it
inspired prophecy of a Mongol devastation of civilization. So
Josephus thought: Gog and Magog were Scythian peoples.
Thrice and four times, on the immense canvases of Asia and
eastern Europe, the fading colors of the Ezekiel vision took on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>the freshness of actuality—and the restoring brush was wielded
in turn by Genghis Khan, Othman, Tamerlane and Akbar. Thus
history has been kind to men of literal minds; but it has seen a
misshapen fable grow up in its shadow. The north had been
the home of the monstrous races of classic myth, and all their
bestial and godless traits were merged in the Tartar tradition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f17">
<img src="images/fig17.jpg" alt="rampart">
<p class="caption">“BUILD US, O DOUL-KARNAIN,” THEY BEGGED, “A RAMPART BETWEEN US AND THEM”</p>
</div>

<p>Bald, deformed anthropophagi mustered behind the barrier
of the Scythian mountains. Gog was the Turkish race, Magog
was the Mongol. The campaigns of Alexander had left legends
that persist to this day in Central Asia, and these were gathered
up in the accumulating myth. Alexander had also left earthworks
and monuments of his marches in those regions, and these
became memorials of the terrible peoples of Ezekiel. At first
the two races were placed a little to the north of Palestine, but
tradition moved them farther to the north and east to bring them
within the Alexander cycle. As Eden was at the end of the east,
so Gog and Magog were in the farther north, “in Scythia beyond
the Caucasus and near the Caspian Sea,” says St. Jerome, writing
in an age when that sea was thought to be a gulf of the
Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>Confused reports about the Chinese wall grew into a fable of
Iskander’s wall, which at one time was deemed to be in the Far
East, and again was identified with the fortifications which the
Sassanid kings had built in the passes of the Caucasus, fragments
of which are still to be seen at Derbent. It seemed most
fitting that the Caucasus with its towering peaks, its broken valleys,
and its remnants of diverse peoples should be the mountain
prison of these predestined scourges of mankind. There
also were to be found the Ten Lost Tribes, who had joined them.
Maundeville merges the two traditions and connects them with
a third; Gog and Magog and their Jewish associates all paid
tribute to the queen of Amazonia. According to Ricold of
Monte Croce, they could not with patience hear Alexander’s
name.</p>

<p>There was a legend that both races escaped, guided by an owl
and a hare over their mountain walls; wherefore the Tartars
wear owl feathers in honor of their deliverance. But Astrakhan
has the story that they are prisoned still in remote valleys of the
Caucasus, where twelve trumpets, blown by the winds, keep them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
in terror against the day when they shall break forth and destroy
the world.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Prester John’s Kingdom</i></p>

<p>When the Christian world was hard put to hold its own in its
crusading adventure in the Holy Land, word came to it that it
had an ally in the rear of Islam. Somewhere in the remote east,
on the farther side of Persia and Armenia, there was a king and
priest who ruled over a Christian people. He had taken the field
with a great army, defeated the Moslem kings of Media and
Persia, seized their capital of Ecbatana, and marched to the
relief of Jerusalem. Without boats to cross the Tigris, he had
gone north into colder lands, intending to cross upon the ice and
reach the holy city by a roundabout road. But the winters
proved too mild, and after waiting several years he had gone
home again.</p>

<p>Thus the Europe of the twelfth century heard the story of
Prester John. In one form or another it was repeated by Otto
of Freisingen, by Maimonides, and by Benjamin of Tudela.
In the travels of the latter, John is a Jewish king reigning in
gorgeous state over a Jewish nation of the deserts. Popular
tradition had it that the royal Christian of Asia had addressed
a letter to the Pope of Rome and to the Greek and Roman emperors.
Its recital of splendors and prodigies was a challenge
to the spirit of wonder.</p>

<p>“I, Presbyter Joannes, the Lord of Lords, surpass all under
heaven in virtue, in riches and in power,” runs the letter. “In
the three Indies our Magnificence rules, and our land extends
beyond India; it reaches towards the sunrise over the wastes, and
it trends towards deserted Babylon near the tower of Babel.
Seventy-two provinces, of which only a few are Christian, serve
us. Each has its own king but all are tributary to us. Our land
streams with honey, and is overflowing with milk. In one region
grows no poisonous herb, nor does a querulous frog ever quack
in it, no scorpion exists, nor does the serpent glide amongst the
grass, nor can any poisonous animals exist in it or injure any
one. With us no one lies, for he who speaks a lie is thenceforth
regarded as dead.”</p>

<p>The royal letter writer recites that in his dominions is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
earthly paradise, claims as his subjects all the peoples of
prodigy, and describes in detail his human menagerie in the
Caucasus. The accursed fifteen nations imprisoned there eat
their foes, only desisting at Prester John’s word. They will
“burst forth at the end of the world, in the time of Antichrist,
and overrun all the abodes of the Saints as well as the great city
Rome, which, by the way, we are prepared to give our son who
will be born, along with all Italy, Germany, the two Gauls,
Britain and Scotland.”</p>

<p>Whether this letter was ever received or no, Pope Alexander
III did dispatch to Prester John a letter which, between the lines,
reads like the reply to an irritating missive. It asserted the
papal claims to universal dominion and demanded that the
priest-king recognize them. The messenger who bore it eastward
in 1177 was never heard of again. Meanwhile the pagan
Mongols had broken into Europe and it became papal policy to
conciliate their good will and if possible win them over as allies
of the Cross against the Crescent. The monkish envoys who
penetrated the heart of Asia found a power as vast as that
claimed for the Christian monarch, but it was in the hands of
the sons of Genghis Khan; and there was no Prester John.</p>

<p>This was a Nestorian fable, said Rubruquis; “about nothing
they make a great fuss.” As to their King John, “I traversed his
pastures and no one knew anything about him.” Rubruquis
speaks of Ung-Khan, prince of a province in Mongolia southeast
of Lake Baikal. According to Marco Polo, who entered
Asia in the same generation, this was Prester John. The Christian
chief of a Hunnish tribe, he was defeated and slain by
Genghis Khan. The legend faded out of the consciousness of
the west, only to be revived and domiciled in Abyssinia when
Europe learned of the power of its sovereigns and that they were
Christians of the Coptic faith.</p>

<p>The tale of this Asiatic priest-king who wanted to put his
armies at the disposal of the hard-beset Christians of the west
has the irony and pathos of allegory. Without purporting to do
so, it tells the story of a great eastern adventure of the church
which the Greek and Roman communions had almost forgotten.
The Nestorians had been cast into outer darkness in one of the
schisms of the Eastern Empire in the unhappy sixth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
when, as Gibbon says, Christians were “more solicitous to explore
the nature, than to practice the laws, of their founder.”
The offense of Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople, was that
he called Mary the Mother of Jesus and not the Mother of God,
and contended that in Christ the divine and human natures subsisted
independently of each other. He was excommunicated,
and died in exile.</p>

<p>His followers, driven from the empire, went forth into Asia
and established an empire of the spirit wide as that afterward
claimed for the Prester John of legend. They founded churches
in Persia, Bokhara, Siam, and Sumatra. They penetrated India
and contended with Buddhism in Tibet. They won millions of
followers in Cathay, where their religion was tolerated under an
imperial edict of the seventh century as “virtuous, mysterious,
and pacific.” From Palestine to China they held the field for
the Christian faith, and their communicants were more numerous
than those of either the Greek or Roman church. There are
places in Asia which have not seen a Christian missionary since
the Nestorians passed, as soon they did. In Kurdistan and
Persia their faith survives in the affections of perhaps three
hundred thousand worshipers.</p>

<p>It was the weakness of this faith that it nowhere had a country
of its own, and therefore no powerful central hierarchy sleepless
in its cause. For better or worse it was never able to draw the
sword; it spread itself only by persuasion and the tolerance of
pagan countries whose princes followed other cults. It must be
that some dreamy Nestorian monk, familiar with the west and
its ways, and pondering what his church had done in Asia and
might have done had the fates been kinder, wrote in the days
of its decline the letter which gave it the country it lacked and
set forth its spiritual dominion in terms the west would understand.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Witch Realm of Lapland</i></p>

<p>In the dark ages a tradition arose that there was a witch
nation in the north of Europe. Its citizens were the Lapps,
whose descendants still fish, hunt and pasture their reindeer in
the wilder districts of Norway, Sweden, Russia, and Finland.
They are the most timid and inoffensive of men. They seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
never to have had government of their own, but have been overtaxed,
exploited, and at times enslaved by stronger neighbors.
Swarthy, dwarfish, and shrill-spoken, with broad heads, upturned
noses, and bandy legs, they may be the survivors of the
small, dark race that once overspread the continent. Such a
people would need supernatural powers to overcome their manifold
handicaps, and with these legend endowed them.</p>

<p>Their sinister reputation came to them because of their
gnome-like aspect, because they were still in the stone age of
culture, and perhaps because they were pagans after the remainder
of Europe had become Christian. Their magic drums
were the terror of settled lands. They could make themselves
invisible. They could raise the winds. “They tye three knottes
on a strynge hangying at a whyp,” wrote Richard Eden in 1577.
“When they lose one of these they rayse tollerable wynds.
When they lose another the wynd is more vehement; but by
losing the thyrd they rayse playne tempests as in old time they
were accustomed to rayse thunder and lyghtnyng.” Tales of
ships which went too near to Lapland and were heard of no
more were rife among the seafaring states. Yet Ivan the Terrible
sent for Lapp magicians to read the portent of a comet,
and the Norse princess Gunhild lived in their country to learn
its lore.</p>

<p>Much of the superstition of the neighbor Finns has entered
into the Lapland tradition. Their magic songs picture their
small cousins as living in almost legendary lands—Lapland
itself, a dark, vague northern country where the people wore
tall hats and spoke in whining, mumbling voices: Turja Fells,
with its wonder-working maidens; and Pohjola, “home of the
north,” where the old woman, Louhiatar, “the blind whore of
Pohjola,” queened it in a realm that had neither sun nor moon.
These songs have much to say of hazy headlands and spells
wrought upon them and on the main. A furious old wife sweeps
the sea, with a cloth of sparks on her head, and on her shoulders
a cloak of foam. Four maidens of the air mow grass on a cloudy
cape in a foggy island. The sharp maiden Terhetar sifts the
mist on a shrouded promontory. A wood spirit shrieks at people
and fills the forest with murk when they wander there.</p>

<p>In the Orkney and Shetland islands, the Lapps were known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
as Finn-folk. Sometimes they crossed the North Sea and, hiding
their identity, appeared among the islanders, with whom they intermarried;
skilled persons, however, detected them by their
wrinkled visages and the odd blemishes upon their skins. The
visitors knew the language of birds and beasts, into which,
indeed, they could transform themselves; and with impunity
they rode the tricky water-horse. They could control the
weather, predict the future, cure diseases of men and cattle. It
was a slight task for them to make the passage from the continent.
Most people believed they swam across—for either they
were seals who took human form, or men who could take the
seal form. Sometimes when fisher folk harpooned a large seal
they found a strange little man struggling in the waves.</p>

<p>These credulous island tales carry the legend of a witch
nation of the north almost into the twentieth century.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Spice Islands</i></p>

<p>The ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> forgot to
mention the Moluccas. A standard atlas of the world published
in the United States neglects to describe them. A day’s sail to
the southeast from the large Philippine island of Mindanao
brings one to them, but American travelers do not make this
trip. Only a strait, to the right and to the left, separates the
group from New Guinea and Celebes, and narrow are the seas
between it and Java to the south; yet these are names of consequence
in modern geography, while it is a name all but unknown.
There is magic, modern magic, in the tropic islands of
the Pacific. These islands do not share it, though they lie on
both sides of the Line in the fairest of summer seas.</p>

<p>They have another name, the Spice Islands. For the space
of two centuries men who followed the great waters thought of
them and of little else. It was spices that Columbus sought
when he sailed west from Palos in 1492 and the man who discovered
sassafras in America had honors comparable to his own.
It was an eastern route to the spice regions that engaged Portuguese
endeavor and conducted the ships of da Gama into the
Indian Ocean in 1497. It was a western route to the Spice
Islands that Magellan sought in his voyage around the world a
score of years afterward. The royal grant to del Cano, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
brought one ship home from that expedition, was conditioned
on the annual payment of two cinnamon sticks, three nutmegs,
and twelve cloves; and the coat of arms which he was licensed
to bear had the effigies of two Malay kings holding spice
branches; to have gone around the world seemed to Spain a
lesser thing than to have discovered a route to these islands.
To reach them was the object of the attempts to open a northeast
passage around Asia and a northwest passage around
America. To determine their ownership was the subject of two
papal bulls and a dynastic agreement between the royalties of
Spain and Portugal; and they fell at last as a prize of war to
Holland.</p>

<p>In the age of discovery India and China were small words
compared with the Spice Islands. The place this forgotten group
once held in the imagination of men is one of the great illusions
of commercial geography.</p>

<p>Nor was it all illusion. If the world trade of antiquity was
mainly in incense, the world trade of the Middle Ages was
mainly in spices, and for a similar cause—with the primitive
transportation of the period, less valuable and more bulky things
could not be carried far at a profit. Nowadays the meats,
grains, vegetables, and fruits of all climes travel long distances
to the dinner table, and men’s diet has both variety and quality.
In former times the range of eatables was small, the quality
poor. The service of spices was to improve and diversify the
flavors of viands, to disguise the shortcomings of mediæval
cookery as well as mediæval larders. The salt-fish diet of
European winters created the spice trade with the east.</p>

<p>When the Turkish seizure of Egypt in 1521 closed the
southern overland route to the east the same year that both the
Portuguese and the Spanish reached the Moluccas, the stage was
set for the romance of spice. Passing from unknown sources
through various hands, it had reached the west at a tenfold price.
Here was opportunity to deal direct in what all Europe wanted.</p>

<p>It was known that these were not the only spice lands. Cassia
grew in Somaliland and cinnamon in Ceylon, and both were
used in food as well as incense. The ginger root came from a
reed of Cochin-China. Benjamin of Tudela, Ibn Batuta, and
Friar Odoric had described the pepper “forests” of Malabar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
and Marignolli had even told of pepper wars between Jews and
Christians. Through the Chinese port of Amoy, so Polo thought,
there passed a hundred times as much pepper as came to all
Christendom. But somehow the Moluccas, whence came cloves,
nutmegs, and mace—the husks of nutmegs—seemed to be the
kingdom of spicery.</p>

<p>They had won this distinction centuries before the first western
ship entered those seas. Although the islands have an area of
only twenty-five thousand square miles and a population of less
than four hundred thousand persons, their two sultanates of
Tidor and Ternate achieved dominion at about the same time
as the Italian republics of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, which in
power they paralleled; and the one group of states, no less than
the other, lived on the spice trade. The colonial empire of the
Moluccas extended over the neighboring archipelagoes and penetrated
the continent; their trading settlements dotted the wide
spaces of Malaysia. Java was their export market, and there
Polo saw the testimonials of their power in a spice trade that
seemed to him to account for the greater part of the world’s
supply of aromatic and pungent vegetable substances. They had
already entered into a political decline when the Europeans
came, and this eastern venture of the Portuguese executed for
them the same decree of fate that it was to do for the maritime
states of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>When Serrano reached the Moluccas he wrote to his friend,
Magellan: “I have discovered yet another new world, larger and
richer than that found by Vasco da Gama.” The caravels of
Portugal went no farther, and the nation took such pains as it
could that none others should go so far. It was Portuguese
policy in the spice trade, as it had been Arab policy in the incense
trade, that the sources of supply should remain unknown.
Always the unknown is magnified. Robert Thorne, writing from
the Spanish court in 1527, declared that the islands abounded
not only in cloves, nutmegs, mace, and cinnamon, but in “Golde,
Rubies, Diamondes, Balasses, Garnates, Jacincts, and other
stones and pearles.” The precious commodities he thought the
simple natives would part with on equal terms for the lead, tin,
and iron of the north; and, measure for measure, they would
traffic their spices for corn, their diamonds for pieces of glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>In these islands fable found another home. Here, it was said,
were men having spurs on their ankles like cocks, horned hogs,
hens that laid their eggs several feet under ground, oysters so
large that the shells were used as baptismal fonts for children,
crabs with claws so strong that they could break the iron of a
pick-ax, stones which grew like fish and out of which men made
lime, and a river well stored with finny creatures and yet so hot
that it scalded the unwary bather. Drake, refitting here in his
voyage around the world, saw “an infinite swarme of fiery
wormes flying at night making such a shew and light as if every
twigge or tree had been a burning candle.” Also he saw bats as
big as hens and crayfish that dug holes like conies, and one of
which was a meal for four hungry men.</p>

<p>These decorations of fancy can add but little to the great
theme of forgotten islands once the goal of the world’s desire.</p>

<p>There was another curious chapter written when Dutch succeeded
Portuguese. It was such a chapter as monopoly writes,
and it comes down into the nineteenth century. The ships of
Holland cruised in the surrounding seas, cutting down spice
groves wherever they found them. Before they were exported,
all nutmegs were treated with fire and lime, so that no plantations
could be started elsewhere—but pigeons carried them to
other islands and mother cloves were taken away in hollow bamboos,
and the produce of home orchards multiplied, and the
world spice trade dwindled in relative importance as the food
of mankind became more varied.</p>

<p>Dampier tells of an island where the ground under the trees
was carpeted with cloves several inches thick, left there to decay.
Another traveler tells of seeing three heaps of nutmegs burning
at one time, each of which would have filled a church. So the
Dutch East India Company reduced supplies in striving to maintain
prices. The spicy odors that floated over the seas surrounding
the Araby of fable became, on occasion, a fact of the
Molucca group. It was the incense neither of nature nor of
religion, but of a dying commerce.</p>

<p>The nutmegs of to-day are grown mainly in the island of
Penang in the British East Indies and in the island of Grenada
in the British West Indies, while cloves come from the African
island of Zanzibar.</p>

<p class="large"><i>Arcadia</i></p>

<p>Arcadia is at once a country and a province of the
imagination.</p>

<p>The real Arcadia is a mountainous plateau some forty miles
square in the central part of the Peloponnessus of Greece. Its
chief exports in the old time were asses. Its inhabitants were—and
are—gruff-spoken herdsmen and peasants, equally scornful
of letters and politics. They seldom went outside their own valleys,
and few strangers came among them. They had no central
government and no relations with the other states of Greece,
and they wanted to be let alone. Yet they were willing to fight—for
pay; and sometimes they had to fight because Sparta was
their neighbor and they were on a war track. When Arcadia
took the field in force as the ally of another state, almost always
it espoused the wrong side. In the quarrels of the Greek republics,
and in the series of wars in which Pompey, Julius Cæsar,
Mark Antony, and Augustus figured, it shared the hard lot of
the vanquished. Although it lay remote and its spirit was aloof,
the plateau had at least its share of the troubles of the world.</p>

<p>The Arcadia of poetry occupies the same boundaries, but has
had a different history. All that the poets have done has been
to stress certain facts and forget the others. This land, as it
seemed to them, stood like a fortress of rustic innocence above
the turmoil of politics and the bustle of maritime trade that was
ancient Greece. At each of the corners of the plateau, like bastions,
rose a group of mountain peaks, from which, on a fair
morning, one might see the whole of Arcadia, the neighbor
states of the coastal plains, and beyond them the Mediterranean.
Great groves of gnarled oaks grew upon the mountain sides,
there were pine forests, and in the open fields stood the graceful
plane tree, beloved of the classic world. Though the Arcadians
were unlettered, pastoral song had its birth among them, before
the inspiration of Theocritus gave it a home in Sicily. Pan was
their tutelar deity, and it seemed to the rustics sometimes that
they could hear the plaintive music of his pipes as the goat-god
reclined under the plane tree. In this artless land, myth has it,
Hermes strung cords across the shell of a giant tortoise and
made the harp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>Arcadia was equally skilled at the harp and the flute, and to
these the shepherds sang their simple lays. Aside from their
love of music, they seemed to the Greeks of the towns men of
ignorant rusticity, and they figure as simpletons—“acorn eaters”—in
the Middle Comedy. The Romans copied this as they did
everything else in Greek drama, and the dull Arcadian of the
stage moved Latin audiences to laughter; “Arcades ambo,” both
sweet innocents, is a phrase of the period. But the Romans
caught also the spirit of their rustic song, and the Arkady of
poetry was born in the Virgilian bucolics. Its outlines are disclosed
in the Tenth <i>Eclogue</i>, in passages which tell of browsing
goats, and clover-rifling bees, and bubbling springs where dark-blue
violets blow, and, animating the scene, the vintagers of
mellow grapes and Pan himself, red with elderberries and with
cinnabar. “Arcadians, none but ye can sing!” exclaims the
poet.</p>

<p>On this delicate outline the Renaissance laid the rich colorings
of its fancy. The rugged, troubled mountain land became
the one land in all the world of simple peace and rustic innocence
and wistful charm of things ideal. Sanazzaro’s Arcadian
pastoral went through sixty editions in a century. France,
Spain, England, and Holland, following Italy, all made their
excursions into Arkady. There was a succession of romantic
sketches wherein lyrics declaring the loves of swains and bewailing
the death of virgins are interspersed with dialogues that
tell in prose the poetry of pastoral life. The classic work of this
school is the <i>Arcadia</i> of Sir Philip Sidney. There, and not in
the Morea, the Arkady that is a province of the imagination may
best be explored.</p>

<p>It is a tale of knightly youths and dainty maidens and one
sentence will declare its quality. When Pamela disrobed for
the bath and set foot in a stream “the touch of cold water made
a pretty kind of shrugging come over her body, like the twinkling
of the fairest of the fixed stars.”</p>

<p>Here, says Sidney, the very shepherds have their fancies
lifted to so high conceits as the learned of other nations are
content both to borrow their names and imitate their cunning.
The hills garnish their proud delights with stately trees, the
humble estate of valleys is comforted with the refreshing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
rivers, and the thickets declare the cheerful disposition of well-tuned
birds. Sheep pasture with sober security and by them
are pretty lambs whose bleating oratory craves the dam’s comfort.
The herd girls sing their lays, while on the uplands pipes
the shepherd boy “as though he shall never be old.”</p>

<p>This is vision, all of it, sunshine and haze working their spell
upon a rocky hillside. There are wolves in the sheepfolds of
life.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Bohemia</i></p>

<p>Bohemia is a subtler Arcadia, another province of youth and
love and dreams; but youth passes thence, and love is a brief
madness, and the dream may fail of fulfillment. Like Arcadia,
the Bohemia that is a state of mind has its reality in a mountain-girdled
land, but, unlike Arcadia, it has shifted on the map,
refusing to be confined by any boundaries known to geography.</p>

<p>Now even the name of it, with its music and implications of
poetry, is lost to geography, and in its stead is the harshly
named Czecho-Slovakia. Wherefore the Bohemians of art and
literature, and unregulated impulse and fantasy, have no homeland
they can call their own. This is a fitting thing. In a sense
there never was a Bohemia, although there was always the
fortress land which nature placed at the headwaters of the Elbe
on the borders of Germany. The Celtic tribe whence it was
named is only a shadow in history, and the Bohemians who
fought with Poles and Germans, who wanted to be Protestant,
who started the Thirty Years’ War, who were a dukedom, and
a kingdom, and a part of the Holy Roman Empire, were Slavs
who called themselves Czechs.</p>

<p>Their literature is older than the German, their university at
Prague was one of the earliest centers of European culture, their
capital is the westernmost outpost of the east in Europe, their
patriotism is a proverb, and their glass fabrics, their beer, and
their beet sugar are staples of world commerce. Upon this
people and their hill-walled home the name of Bohemia and the
traditions of “the gayest and most melancholy country of the
world” fit but loosely. Whence the Bohemia that is a haunting
word on the lips of youth?</p>

<p>Shakespeare budded it, and the gypsies, and Frenchmen who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
knew too little, and Frenchmen who may have known too much.
<i>Winter’s Tale</i> gave Bohemia a seacoast and centuries of
critics a chance to say its author nodded. Yet under the puissant
Ottokar the country did have coasts on both the north and
south of Europe. The scene of the play is near the head of the
Adriatic. The Bohemia it pictures, instead of lying inland, is
probably the maritime province of Istria, and historically the
background is correctly named.</p>

<p>From <i>Winter’s Tale</i> the Bohemians of the studio and pothouse
got themselves a coast, a glamour, and their First Citizen.
“Places remote enough are in Bohemia,” the poet says. Here
again is shepherd’s love, and a prince whose courtship of a
“queen of curds and cream” is timed by the flowers as they pass—“daffodils
that come before the swallow dares, and take the
winds of March with beauty,” and violets dim, pale primroses,
bold ox-lips and the flower de luce. “The fanned snow that’s
bolted by the northern blasts” is far away.</p>

<p>On this scene of Arkady enters a figure in no wise Arcadian—Autolycus,
earliest Bohemian, citizen of no country and of
all. He is a vagabond, a minstrel, a ballad-monger, a ribbon
peddler, a cut-purse. His is the footpath way, and his revenue,
he explains, is the silly cheat. “Enter Autolycus singing” is the
stage direction. Exit Autolycus also, singing, “A merry heart
goes all the day, your sad tires in a mile-a.”</p>

<p>Here is a blood-brother of Villon, and Bohemia is already a
province of his song. It becomes a kingdom with the coming of
the gypsies. Mediæval France called them Bohemians, and
thought them such, as other countries thought them Egyptians.
The roadside was their home, the world was their country, they
paid no taxes or rents, and report had it that they had written
the canons of their creed on cabbage leaves which a donkey
found and devoured. They practiced the wandering arts, were
musicians, metal-workers, horse-dealers, bear-leaders, snake-charmers,
herb-venders; their women read palms, and were
“pleasaunt dauncers.”</p>

<p>The gypsy philosophy found its first devotees in rogues of old
Paris, who called themselves dukes in Bohemia; Hugo has
sketched their lawless commonwealth in his <i>Notre Dame</i>. The
Bohemia of artists and dreamers, like many a country of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
map, had ruffians, cheats, and vagrants for its early colonists.
It was left to Murger to fix its frontiers, write its laws, and treat
for its admission into the league of ideal lands. The results are
spread at large in his <i>Scenes de la Vie de Bohème</i>.</p>

<p>Much has been written of the whereabouts of this land and
of the conditions by which one becomes a citizen, but the matter
is found entire in Murger’s preface and in Arthur Symons’s introduction
to this preface. “Any man,” says Murger, “who
enters the path of Art, with his art as his sole means of support,
is bound to pass by way of Bohemia.” To Symons, Bohemia is
“the sentiment youth has of itself at the flowering moment of its
existence”; the sadness of it is the consciousness of the flight of
youth.</p>

<p>The whereabouts of the country that has been mapped as
neighbor both to Germany and Italy? Murger answers that
Bohemia “neither exists nor can exist anywhere save in Paris.”
But that is only Murger’s answer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c17">Chapter XVII. Islands of Enchantment</h2>
</div>


<p>“<span class="smcap large">The</span> thirteenth day of May we passed by the Island of Paris,
and the Island of the bankes of Helicon, and the Island called
Ditter, where are many boares and the women bee witches.”
This glimpse of Mediterranean travel from one of the sixteenth-century
wanderers whose voyages are recorded in Hakluyt
might be paralleled from the outer Atlantic, the Caribbean, the
Indian Ocean, or the South Seas. In the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, for
example, Sayf Al-Muluk and his companions came in turn to
the isle of the old men of the sea; to the isle of ghouls who sleep
under cover of their ears; to the isle of gigantic blackamoors
with protruding eyeteeth; and to the isle of trained apes “bigger
than he-mules.”</p>

<p>Such folk seem at home in the wilderness of waters. These
distant spaces of the sea are little worlds of their own which
imagination feels free to dower with peculiar institutions and
stock with peculiar peoples. In islands of reality or fantasy
men place their ideal states, their pirate realms, their abodes of
exile, their refuges from the restraints and traditions of life—the
sanctuaries of pursuits and companionships other than those
of which they have tired. In them, also, they place the regions
of repose; to reach felicity one must cross water.</p>

<p>On journeys thither one might sight the shores of the folk of
prodigy. There were islands of men, and islands of women,
and islands of hermits, and islands of witches, and islands of
satyrs, and islands of giants, and islands of dwarfs, and islands
of dog-headed, ox-worshiping cannibals. The impulse thus to
set aside a maritime domicile for the nondescript nations was
strongest with Arab geographers and Celtic story-tellers. It
culminates in the romancing narrative of Maundeville, who
dotted the eastern seas with the archipelagoes of his fancy and
settled them with the creatures of fable.</p>

<p>When the spell of terror woven in classic times began to lift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
from the Atlantic, its islands swam into sight as to the strains
of harp music. They appeared to belong equally to geography
and to poetry. Of Madeira, the discovery of which is associated
with the romance of fugitive English lovers, an old writer
declared that such a delightful land “could only have been discovered
by love.” For reasons as yet unexplained, nearly all
the newly found islands of the eastern Atlantic bore the names
of animals or birds. About them, Sir John Hawkins wrote, “are
certaine flitting Ilands which have been oftentimes seene, and
when men approched neere them, they vanished.” The older
maps show one such island which was called St. Brendan’s. It
is a memory of the Irish sea epics, and the latter are themselves
a review of the entire island story.</p>

<p>In these five wander-tales the empty spaces of the Atlantic are
filled in with islands which were loaned to the Irish by Homer
from the Odyssey and Plato from his Atlantis; by the Greek,
Lucian, from his Rabelaisian <i>True History</i>; by the Roman,
Seneca, with his vision of a continent in the west; by him who
saw the Sea of Glass from the rock of Patmos; by Arab story-tellers,
and by early Moorish and Spanish chroniclers from their
narratives of the shadowy Antillia, the Isle of the Seven Bishops,
and the legendary journey of the Deluded Folk. Celtic fancy
passed a wand over this jumble of material, and a strange new
world appeared. Headlands of snow and ice and islands of
perpetual summer were within a day’s sail of one another,
pagan fables and monkish marvels were domiciled together,
there was much mist and much sunshine, and around all was
“the mighty and intolerable ocean” which St. Brendan saw at
Sliabh Daidche.</p>

<p>Tennyson has set one of these tales, <i>The Voyage of Mældune</i>,
to his own music. It was a journey of revenge a chieftain
made with his men to slay the man who has slain his father.
They came to the Silent Isle, where their voices were thinner and
fainter than any flittermouse shriek; to the Isle of Shouting
where wild birds cried from its summit till the steer fell down
at the plow and the harvest died in the field; to the Isle of
Flowers where were blossom and promise of blossom and never
a fruit; to the Isle of Fruits, and in every berry and fruit the
poisonous pleasure of wine; to the Isle of Fire, which shuddered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
and shook like a man in a mortal affright; to the Bounteous Isle,
where the men began to be weary, to sigh and to stretch and
yawn; to the Isle of Witches, naked as heaven, who bosomed the
burst of the spray; to the Isle of the Double Towers, that shocked
on each other and butted each other with clashing of bells; and
to the Isle of a Saint, who told the men, “Go back to the Isle of
Finn, and suffer the past to be past.”</p>

<p>This narrative may stand with variations for all of the Irish
sea tales. Under the sway of some overmastering motive the
hero puts forth upon the deep—for revenge, or to save a comrade
condemned, or to seek a woman, or to reach the Land of
Promise, or to find the Lord upon the sea. The voyagers pass
from island to island. Complaisant Circes greet them from one
shore and indignant female virtue repels them from another.
They come to the isle called the Delicious, to the Isle of Sheep,
to the Isle of Laughter, to the Moving Isle which was a whale’s
back, to the isle which is the mouth of hell. They see demons
racing their horses on a magic course, and red-hot swine issuing
from caves, and stinging cats, and Judas on his rock, and ants
the size of foals. A griffin assaults them, the Cyclopes threaten
them, birds sing psalms to them. Repentant, or triumphant, or
prophetic, or stricken in years, they come back at last to an
Ireland that has forgotten them.</p>

<p>Who fares on from island to island with these Celtic dreamers
may visit the whole realm of fable.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Sunken Lands</i></p>

<p>Gazing into the ocean depths in warm latitudes one sees the
fronds of tall aquatic plants sway slightly as if a slow breeze
stirred them. Walls of coral rise there with a wavering semblance
to palaces. The purple mullet swims in and out of sunken
grottos. Such sunlight as reaches them is subdued to softness,
like that admitted by cathedral windows when it is late afternoon.
These seem to be groves and gardens and habitations
under the sea. Beings like one’s fellow mortals, but more beautiful
and gentle, might live there and rove in the dim peace of
meadows beneath the foam and tumult of the reefs.</p>

<p>Such thoughts come without bidding. Always men have
sought the land of heart’s desire, and sometimes they told themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
that it was under the sea; or perhaps that what they saw
there was not the promise of what should be but the wreck of
what had been.</p>

<p>The sea is a mirror as well as a window. It repeats the
curves of shore and sky and all that is between—cornfields, and
grazing cattle, and the burden of orchards, and cottage smoke,
and the loom of church towers. Here is an underworld, though
it be but the simple magic of light upon smooth water. There is
a subtler magic of mist and water and uncertain sun gleams
when one stands on the west coast of Ireland and looks seaward
through the eyes of a people in whom wonder never flickered
down in doubt.</p>

<p>Dwelling alone on the outer coast of the world as the ancients
knew it, these folk had beheld strange things in the great waters
that roared along their cliffs. Shadowy islands showed themselves
in thick weather, and, though no trace of them remained
when the cloud bank lifted, these were no tricks of mirage
wrought by fog and muffled sunlight. They were isles of enchantment
that might have floated out of sight, but more likely
had sunk beneath the wave, not to emerge again until another
seven years were gone. The glints of splendor upon the distant
sea were not the track of the sun in broken water. They came
from the golden roofs and spires of a sunken city.</p>

<p>So out of things seen—as in a glass darkly—upon, above, and
under the billow, and out of things imagined or hoped for, men
have wrought the legend of cities that sleep beneath the ocean.
The tale of Atlantis is the oldest form of the legend. But the
tales of lost cities are not legend altogether and the tale of
Atlantis may not be legend altogether. There are submerged
ruins on which romance bases itself as upon reality, there are
authentic historical happenings, and there are local traditions
which, it may be, retain the memory of cities that were upon
islands or coasts engulfed by the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f18">
<img src="images/fig18.jpg" alt="islands">
<p class="caption"><i>In Islands Men Placed Their Ideal States.... To Reach Felicity One Must<br>
Cross Water</i></p>
</div>

<p>Along the Italian coast the columns of sunken Roman villas
have given rise to stories of drowned cities. The ruins of towns
lie under the Zuyder Zee. Some inroad of the deep may be
preserved in the legend of Vineta, the fabled city beneath the
Baltic near the Holstein coast. There have been subsidences
within historical time in the waters about the British Isles, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>the ocean has taken toll of the English coast itself. The Channel
shoal called the Goodwin Sands, and Seal Rock, fragment of the
Irish island of Inis Fitæ which was split into three pieces in the
eighth century, are tokens of these subsidences. In the Azores
group, scene of the Atlantis legend, four islands appeared in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and sank again. Expedition
Island, northwest of Australia, which Dutch naturalists
visited within a generation, lies under seven fathoms of water.
The populous island of Torca in the Indian Ocean went out of
sight in a sheet of flame in 1693. Tuanaki, an island in South
Polar waters, has not been seen in ninety years. The cloud bank
which Peary called Crocker Land has been removed from maps
of the Arctic region. Three new islands have been born in the
Aleutian group, one of them as late as 1909. The strange
stone images on Easter Island have given rise to conjecture that
it might be the remnant of a continent and a civilization lost
beneath the Pacific.</p>

<p>Thus there is a broad basis of fact for the legends of sunken
cities. Some of these are of great beauty. Whether the product
of pagan or Christian brooding, the sound of church bells is in
them—peals that come floating solemnly to the surface from
towers through which deep waters are moving. When the sunshine
falls upon calm seas, so fisherman say, they can discern
these towers, and rising about them the peaked roofs of houses
like those of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Beyond all others the Celts are the people of the lost lands.
These seem part of the Celtic heritage of defeat and dreams.
The legends of Wales tell of a fair land sunken by the folly of
a drunken prince. The lost Lyonesse, a great promontory of
Cornwall, was such another land, and the Scilly Islands are the
remnants. Tennyson and Swinburne have rescued its memory
from oblivion and Walter de la Mare pictures a scene “in sea-cold
Lyonesse, when the Sabbath eve shafts down on the roofs,
walls and belfries of the foundered town.” The story of Is,
the vanished Breton capital, has been told in folk-song, in
poetry, in stately music. It is one of the haunting fables of
men, and back of it, as of so many tales of ruin and overthrow,
is the figure of a beautiful and wicked woman.</p>

<p>The city of Is lay far in the west of France, where the coast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
of Brittany makes its great thrust into the Atlantic. Peasants
point out the blocks, visible at low tide in the Bay of Douarnenez,
which they say are its foundations. The city was builded
in a wide plain below the level of the sea, and strong walls, controlled
by sluice gates, defended it from the encroaching waves.
It was an habitation of vice and pleasure, and it had a king as
blameless as Arthur, and he a daughter as cruel, as lustful, and
as fair of face as Arthur’s sister, Morgan le Fay. King Gradlon
and Princess Dahut are the central figures in the drama of Is.</p>

<p>Dahut dwelt in a tower, where she entertained a long train
of lovers, drowning each as she tired of him. To please a paramour
she stole from her father’s neck in his sleep the silver key
which unlocked the sluice gates and let in the sea. Awakened
by the warning tumult of the waters, Gradlon mounted a horse
and fled, bearing his daughter with him. But the floods moved
after him and a voice bade him sacrifice to the sea the beautiful
demon who rode with him. Dahut fell to her death in the
waves, and their course was stayed. At Quimper the king rebuilt
his seat, but Is was lost forever beneath the Atlantic.
Though it happened fifteen centuries ago, there are Bretons who
say that the faint chime of bells still comes to them when wind
and tide move shoreward together.</p>

<p>Nine is the number of islands under the sea to the west of
Erin. They appear above the surface once in seven years.
Though a man may descry them from the coast, yet might he go
toward them in a currach for two days and not come up with
them. Some of them are larger than Ireland itself. They have
been seen by trustworthy observers,—Otway, for example. In
a paper read before the Royal Irish Society, Westropp describes
O Brasile, the best known of these, as he saw it in 1872: “It was
a clear evening with a fine golden sunset, when, just as the sun
went down, a dark island suddenly appeared far out to sea, but
not on the horizon. It had two hills, one wooded; between these,
from a low plain, rose towers and curls of smoke. My mother,
brother, and several friends saw it at the same time. One cried
out that he could see New York!”</p>

<p>Illusion, but for thousands of years Irish eyes have beheld
these phantom islands lift and fade in the west, and the Celtic
glamour is in the legends that tell them. “Lost Kilsapheen,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
sighs the poet, “its palaces and towers of pride ... all buried
in the rushing tide and deep sea waters green.” Churches and
convents and castles are in these islands, and those who have
seen them or thought they saw them report more intimate touches—an
old woman coming out of a cabin to cut a cabbage; the
bleating of sheep and lambs heard in a fog on the open sea; the
apparition of “an old Scotch gentleman” wearing the raiment
of another century upon an enchanted shore. Sometimes a
seeming of tumult troubles these realms of shadow. There are
flames and smoke and fugitives. Then the spell passes and there
is naught but the slant of the gull’s wing and the roll of a porpoise
on a distant billow.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the islands are people of a vanished time,
and sealmen, and mermen, and giants, and the prisoners of
giants. If you can find the golden key to one of the sunken
lands it will rise to the surface and remain there; but the key
has been hidden under a cairn or is buried in the ruins of a
Druid temple. There are other ways of lifting the spell.
Casting a clod of earth upon an island when it is above water
may disenchant it. Another way is by dropping a coal of fire
upon it, or knocking the glowing ashes from your pipe upon the
shore, or shooting a red-hot arrow from a boat, for “fire is hostile
to anything phantasmal.” So was Inishbofin fixed above the
surface of the sea. Fishermen landed upon it in a fog and lit
a fire. Then the fog cleared and they saw an old woman driving
a white cow to drink. One of them seized the cow’s tail and
found in his hand a spray of seaweed; and the woman and cow
were turned into rocks. This was ages ago.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Where Eden Lies</i></p>

<p>Eden, Elysium, and the Fortunate Isles are one. They are
upon the earth and yet not of it. They are no part of the realm
of shades and it is not through the gates of death that one enters
them. Mortal men have dwelt in them, or may reach them, and
thither the heroes pass without leaving “the warm precincts of
the cheerful day.” These are the ideal lands of afternoon sunshine
and airs that are at once a sigh and a caress. The poetry
and pity of men created them that there might be some place of
happiness with portals less somber than those of the tomb, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
without the sadness of irrevocable farewells upon the paths that
lead to it.</p>

<p>So the realms of bliss were placed afar, at the end of difficult
journeys which yet might be attained, or at least attempted.
Eden lay eastward. The Fortunate Isles of the Roman and the
Elysian lands of the Greek and Celt lay westward. In the conception
of men these were islands, Eden almost as much as the
others. The four sacred rivers flowed from it and around it,
and in later times, what men who came near to it particularly
noticed was the sound of falling water.</p>

<p>It seemed to Columbus that the rushing current of the Orinoco
flowed down from Eden’s steeps. It seemed to men before him
that paradise might lie in the southern hemisphere, deemed “the
noblest and happiest part of the globe,” and perhaps in the
South Seas. There were those who made Eden a coast on the
northern ocean, and others who placed it among the fountains of
Armenia. To most men the island of Ceylon was its seat.
There Carpini heard the plash of its waters, and Maundeville
drank thereof, as he reports, to his bodily betterment.</p>

<p>The Fortunate Isles, the Elysian abode of the heroes, were
placed by the Greeks in the extreme west, near the river
Oceanus. Their position receded with the advance of world-knowledge
and finally was fixed in the Canary and Madeira
islands, furthest outpost of Roman discovery. Satire though it
is, the <i>True History</i> of Lucian describes the Blessed Islands in
the very term men used when they were glad to believe. As his
party approached these islands, odorous airs came out from
shore, in which one could detect the mingled breath of the rose,
the narcissus, the hyacinth, and the lily. There was music from
harp and lute, and then, as the boat grounded on the beach, “the
guardians of the isle immediately chained us with manacles of
roses, their only fetters.”</p>

<p>These were the same islands which the Celts called by many
beautiful names and whither the coracles of legend journeyed.
It is hard to tell where the sunken islands of their history give
way to the imaginary islands of their geography, and these to
the ideal lands of their myths. The three groups seem to lie one
behind the other in the outer seas of the <i>Imrama</i>. The farthest
group was the Celtic other-world, and yet so near was it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
coasts of the New World, that a claim for the discovery of
America is based on St. Brendan’s voyage to the Land of
Promise. The group may best be called an archipelago where
pagan and Christian ideals shared dominion. Therein was not
only the Land of Promise, but “Magh Mell of many flowers,”
the Land of Truth, “whose truth was sung without falsehood.”
There was the Land of the Living, and the sensuous Land of
Fair Women. In all these happy islands music swelled, and
laughter, and there was neither wailing nor treachery, and death
was not; and the magic food was unsalted pork, new milk, and
mead.</p>

<p>It was the singular fate of this god’s land of the Celt to
become confused with the geographical story of both Europe and
America. The memory of actual Irish voyages to the New
World may be in the legend, and inference from wreckage carried
from afar, along with the stuff of old dreams. Of the
latter is a Spanish story wherein the Celtic paradise masks itself
as the Island of the Seven Cities to which seven bishops had led
their flocks to escape the Moor. Men whose hap it was to sight
this shadowy coast were carried in a barge to the shore and
entertained in a lofty hall by men who spoke their own tongue,
though with the antique accent. Europe credited the tale, nor
guessed that the barge was the same as that which bore the
wounded Arthur unto Avalon.</p>

<p>These dream isles, at once aspiration and allegory, were
found also, or rather they were sought, in the eastern seas. It
is recited in the Buddhist records that the king of Udyana had
a true report of the silver walls and golden roofs of an island
of the sages in distant waters. The Chinese emperor, Tshe
Huan Ti, of the third century before Christ, heard of a happy
land seven hundred miles to the eastward in the Yellow Sea,
and sent young men out to find it. They saw it on a far horizon
and a roseate light was upon it. But storms drove them back.
The Japanese tell of such a land lying toward the sunrise, and
call it Oraisan.</p>

<p>Maundeville knew of an island in the eastern ocean. It was
something like the places of eternal bliss in the far west, and
yet was the home of people who were much as other men are
except that they were better. When Alexander would have conquered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
them, an embassy bore him this message, “Nothing may
thou take from us but our good Peace,” and he let them alone.
In this isle of Bragman was “No Thief, nor Murderer, nor common
Woman, nor poor Beggar, nor ever was Man slain in that
Country. And because they be so true and so righteous, and so
full of all good Conditions, they were never grieved with Tempests,
nor with Thunder, nor with Lightning, nor with Hail, nor
with Pestilence, nor with War, nor with Hunger, nor with any
other Tribulation, as we be, many Times, amongst us, for our
Sins.”</p>

<p>The island paradises of mankind lie upon many waters and
in every quarter of the earth. Alike for the Indians of Chile
and of the American Northwest, Elysium was in the distant
Pacific. The natives of Haiti believed it was in western valleys
of their own island. The natives of Australia called it “the
gum-tree country.” The Semang of the Malay Peninsula said
it was across the sea in a land of screw pines and thatch palms.
It was their ancient island home, said the people of the Celebes.
It was northwest of Tonga, the Friendly Islanders thought, and
Bulotu was the name they gave it; yams and breadfruit were
plentiful there, hogs abounded, and there were reefs for shark-catching.
Many Kanaka tribes named it Havaika, which is
perhaps Java, or the Samoan island of Savaii, points of dispersion
in their migrations. The natives of Torres Straits called
it the island of Kibu; in its treetops ghosts sat twittering. But
the Solomon Islander could hear their laughter as they bathed
in the surf of his own sea-befriended paradise. “These Marquesas,”
a nun said to Frederick O’Brien, “make no more of
death than of a journey to another island, and much less than
of a journey to Tahiti.”</p>

<p>Among races of higher culture Elysium takes on a more
ordered beauty, yet remains naïve. Annwfn is its Brythonic
name and it lies at the end of a long voyage; no infirmity is
there, and sweeter than white wine is the drink from its mighty
well. Before men embarked for it, they said in Babylon, there
was a formidable land journey to take, over a high pass guarded
by scorpion men in the mountains of Masu, along a road of
black darkness, through a park of precious stones, across a
bitter river—and then the waters of death; these may have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
the Atlantic, or the sea of the Arabs. Elysium was far to the
east in some mellow clime beyond the ocean, so the Slavs
thought; and thither the birds and insects went in autumn. It
is a land of lotus lakes in the west, and its name is Sukhavati,
say the Buddhists of Nippon; out of it comes a continual harmony
of flowing rivers, murmuring leaves, and soft bells swung
by softer winds. It is a kingdom in the northern ocean and its
name is Vaikuntha, some Hindus say. Others speak of a paradise
which they call Svetadvipa, “the white island” that is
somewhere in the north beyond the Sea of Milk.</p>

<p>For inland peoples the thought of a sea to be crossed, as
every day the sun crosses the sea to its rest, gave way at times
to the thought of a river with a difficult bridge, and paradise on
the farther side. Such in the Hindu classics was the land of the
Uttarakarus which lay on the shores of the northern ocean beyond
the radiance of the sun and the moon. A river that petrified
whatever entered it flowed between it and the countries
of the south. Lakes with golden lotuses and tanks of crystal
water shimmered in the light airs of this favored land. In its
odorous orchards birds always sang, and beautiful maidens,
hanging by their long hair, grew among the blossom-burdened
branches—another glimpse of the enigmatic women of Wak-wak.
Amid the sound of music and laughter these Indian
Hyperboreans did their pious deeds, nor shed the god-unlawful
tear, until ten thousand and ten hundred years had passed.
Then they died, and fowls with sharp beaks carried their bodies
to mountain caves.</p>

<p>An Irish myth of the Middle Ages holds closer to the facts
of existence than any of these stories of terrestrial felicity, and
there is a note of sadness in the beauty of it. In a lake in
Munster were the islands of life and death. There was no port
for death to enter the first island, but age and pain and sickness
were there, and all the wearinesses of years. Its inhabitants
learned at last to look on the opposite island as the place of
repose, and, steering their barks to its shore, they entered upon
eternal rest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c18">Chapter XVIII. The Terrible Ocean</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> some of its moods the sea presents itself as a symbol of
eternity. For ages it was more than the symbol; it was eternity
itself. Men shrank from contemplation of it, as they might
shrink from contemplation of the hereafter. A voyage into its
outer spaces was like the voyage of the soul into the shadows
that lie beyond life. Still, this conception shapes the imagery
and colors the faith of the race. Life is a passage down a river
that reaches an immeasurable sea. Death is a journey upon
dark waters. The bark of salvation spreads its sails for the pure
of heart, and favoring winds waft them to the Beautiful Shore.
In the songs of Christendom one hears soft winds blowing over
expanses of peaceful water. The earth geography of Homer is
the heavenly geography of Bunyan. The Ocean Stream that
flowed around the world is the river that flows by the Throne of
God.</p>

<p>Classic mythology ties up the sea’s infinities with those of
time through the medium of the Styx, which was at once a
branch of the Ocean Stream and the river that encircled the
land of shades. The lake of Avernus which afforded entrance
to the nether world, Charon’s ferry, the rivers Cocytus, Acheron,
and Phlegethon, and the Stygian Pool itself, all gave to a Roman
death the aspect of maritime adventure, although underground.
The freer Greek fancy placed the Elysium of the soul somewhere
in the western ocean, where the sun sank to rest. There
were the Isles of the Blessed, or Fortunate Isles, where there was
neither rain nor snow, but the shrilly-breathing west wind fanned
and watered the land.</p>

<p>Other isles were there, the abodes of formidable men and
dangerous women and prodigious animals. But one could get
along very well by accepting the fictions of the poets as good
enough geography and ethnography without launching maritime
expeditions to confirm them. The western ocean offered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
peoples of the Mediterranean no present promise or profit to
match its terrors, and to alloy delights that had too spectral a
cast. Unlike the Indian Ocean, it was not a great highway of
trade. Thick clouds covered it, perpetual darkness reigned
upon it. It was an unnavigable morass and a confusion; so
said Hesiod, Pindar, and Euripides, voicing the beliefs of their
time.</p>

<p>There was one race that without fear put forth upon the sea.
This was the Phœnicians, and their rich African colony, the
Carthaginians. Their adventures beyond the Pillars of Hercules
brought profit to them, and they saw to it that the tidings
of them should bring dismay to others. A Phœnician fleet sent
out by Necho, a Pharaoh of the XXXVIth dynasty, seems to
have sailed around Africa. About <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 500 a Carthaginian
fleet under Hanno explored the African west coast as far as the
mouths of the Senegal and Gambia. At nearly the same time
another Carthaginian fleet under Himilco discovered the British
Isles, but it brought back depressing stories. The islands were
four months’ distant from the Straits of Gibraltar, and the
voyage thither was through waters haunted by frightful monsters
and thick with entangling seaweed, where wild storms and
protracted calms succeeded one another.</p>

<p>These were not true tales, but other nations believed them,
and the seafaring Semites were permitted to build up trading
stations along the coasts of the outer ocean—in western Africa,
in Lusitania, in the Scilly Islands, and in Cornwall. None challenged
their monopoly of the tin trade of the Cassiterides.
They covered their tracks so that whoever had the temerity to
test their fables, or seek to tap their sources of raw material,
would not know whither to go. Strabo tells how the Carthaginians
concealed from everyone the passage to the Tin Islands:
“When the Romans followed a certain shipmaster, that they also
might find the market, the shipmaster of jealousy purposely ran
his vessel upon a shoal, leading on those who followed him into
the same destructive disaster. He himself escaped by means of
a fragment of the ship, and received from the state the value of
the cargo he had lost.”</p>

<p>According to Eratosthenes, the Carthaginians went further:
“They drown any strangers who sail past on their voyage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
Sardinia or to the Pillars.” Thus through piracy, stratagem,
and fable they maintained their monopoly on the waters of the
west, and for once Greek curiosity played into a rival’s hands.
Tyrian and Punic marvel tales were elaborated and adorned by
the poets of Attica, until everyone felt that a journey beyond the
Pillars was a thing not to be undertaken. All that the earlier
Greeks knew, even of the western Mediterranean, was that near
it was a mountain called Atlas on which the sky rested, and that
the world ended at the pillars set up by Hercules.</p>

<p>One Greek was determined to learn more, and see if his countrymen
could not also profit from the tin and amber trades.
The journey of Pytheas of Massilia, at about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 333, along
the coasts of northern Europe is one of the noteworthy scientific
expeditions of history. He is the first to speak of Thule. He
found where amber came from. He noted that the cereals
gradually disappeared as one traveled north, that the northern
grain was threshed in barns instead of upon open threshing
floors, and that fermented drinks there were made from corn
and honey. In a peculiar passage he asserted that beyond
Britain there was neither earth, air, nor sea, but a mixture of
all three—something like the element which held the universe
together. This substance, which he compared to the jellyfish,
rendered navigation impossible and led the Romans later to
name those waters the Sluggish Sea. The apparently fabulous
statement, made on hearsay, has been interpreted as referring
to the dense fogs of the northern seas, to the blended effects of
mist and light, and to the broken ice or slush that floats there in
a translucent state. The reference to the jellyfish may be either
to its translucence or its luminosity.</p>

<p>All that Pytheas reported of northern Europe was discredited.
How, asks Polybius, could a private individual conduct such a
vast expedition with his narrow means? Strabo accuses the
Massilian of having forged his tales, “making use of his acquaintance
with astronomy and mathematics to fabricate his
false narration.” His complete vindication is the work of
modern scholarship.</p>

<p>The next report of consequence from the outer seas comes
nearly three centuries later and was made to Sertorius, the
Marian general under whom for a time Spain maintained its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
independence of Rome. A tale of the Fortunate Islands—probably
of the Canaries—drifted in through the Straits and found
the great soldier weary of life in camp and field. Two sailors
had arrived from islands which they described as about twelve
hundred miles west of the coast of Africa. Rains seldom fell
there, they said. The dews watered the earth, which yielded its
fruits in abundance without the labor of man. The seasons were
temperate, the air was serene and pleasant, and soft winds blowing
from the west and south brought days of bright moist
weather. Even the barbarians believed that this was the seat of
the blessed.</p>

<p>There was that in the jaded commander which lifted to the
thought of new horizons. Sertorius, says Plutarch, was seized
with a wonderful passion for these islands and had an extreme
desire to go and live there in peace and quietness, safe from
oppression and unending wars. But the Cilician pirates, who
were his allies, wanted not peace, but spoils. So the remainder
of his life was spent in wars and government, and the world
was denied an adventure instinct with romance and pregnant
with the potencies of great discovery.</p>

<p>With the voyage of Polybius in the fleet of Scipio along the
west African coast, the campaigns of Cæsar in Gaul and Britain
and the reduction of both into imperial provinces, even the
incurious Roman became possessed of adequate geographical
knowledge of the western coasts of Europe and the waters near
them. This knowledge, however, was tinctured with the marvelous,
and was not long retained. Strabo, for example, pictures
the men of the Scilly, or Tin, Islands as wearing black
cloaks and tunics reaching to the feet, and as walking with
staves, thus “resembling the Furies we see in tragic representations.”
He must have meant the Druids.</p>

<p>In the same century in which the legions were withdrawn
from Britain, Procopius, the foremost historian of the Eastern
Roman Empire, was born. Yet in that century of dissolution
most of what the ancient world had learned of the coasts and
waters of the Atlantic was forgotten. The western ocean had
been a domain over which mists of ignorance and superstition
hovered, sometimes rising for a moment of distant vision, sometimes
falling like a blank curtain. In the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></span>
they drew so closely to the shores of Europe that even England
was lost behind them. It had ceased to be a Roman province
and was become a land of ghosts.</p>

<p>Procopius tells his story with due note of its dreamlike quality;
and yet, he says, numberless men vouch for its truth. It
is the story of the English Channel become the ferry of souls.
The fisher folk on the continental side are subject to the Franks,
but pay no tribute, because it is their task in regular turn to
transport the souls of the dead to Britain. Those on duty for
each night keep indoors until a knocking is heard and a mysterious
voice summons them. Arising from sleep, they go down
to the beach, where they find strange boats awaiting them. These
seem to be empty, but when they seize the oars and push off they
find the gunwales only an inch above the water. In silence they
make the journey and in an hour find themselves on the opposite
shore, although their own skiffs could scarcely cross in a night
and a day. When the keels grate on the beach, suddenly the
boats ride high on the waves. There is none to greet them, but
again a voice is heard, announcing the name and station of the
spectral passengers.</p>

<p>Thus the end of the ancient world found men knowing only
a little more about the western ocean than they did at the beginning.
The chief advance over the Homeric age was that they
knew it was an ocean and not a circumfluent river. The old
idea was not dead that it was a morass made unnavigable by
seaweed and mud, too thick and too shallow for sailing ships
to venture upon. This notion was fostered by observing the
unfamiliar phenomena of ebb tides, with the long windrows of
weed and the wide expanses of muddy flats they laid bare upon
the coasts. Plato had deepened the belief and provided a reason
for it in his story of Atlantis. “That is the reason,” he concludes,
“why the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable,
because there is such a quantity of shallow mud in the
way.”</p>

<p>Men had no such notions, or fears of the open seas to the
east, although they were careful not to get too far from their
shores. They knew that inhabited lands were beyond them, and
that by not impossible shores and islands they could reach these.
The Periplus of the Erythræan Sea had full accounts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
coasts from Aden clear to the mouth of the Ganges, and reports
also on Indo-China and China itself. There were pirate-haunted
archipelagoes and islands tenanted by the monsters of Oriental
fancy. But these were Eastern waters and it behooved men to
know something about them and to take a chance upon them, for
a great traffic moved across them—silken fabrics, spices, pepper,
gold and silver and precious stones from the hidden storehouses
of Asia. Wherefore men faced the seas of sunrise with no such
fears as invaded them when they looked out upon the empty and
spectral Atlantic.</p>

<p>Another race beside the Phœnician was unafraid of the western
sea. This was the Northmen, of whom it was said that they
never slept under a smoke-blackened roof, nor ate and drank at
any hearth. Their tradition looked outward, where that of the
Mediterranean races looked inward. The ocean was the whale
path of their skalds, and their hearts sang along it. Its waters
carried the challenge and promise of the present, not the glooms
or pallors of the hereafter. When their long boats drove
through the Straits of Gibraltar into the old Roman world to
pillage and rule there, it was the return visit of the men of the
outer spaces, ferocious and blithe sea-rovers who thus requited
the trafficking and timid excursions of Phœnician and Roman
into the seas that washed the continent.</p>

<p>The very names of Viking chieftains—Sigurd Snake-eye,
Thord the Yeller, Ottar the Swart, Harold Blue-tooth, Eric
Blood-ax, Thorfinn Skull-cleaver, Sweyn Split-beard—sketched
a hardihood that made light of supernatural terrors upon the sea
and knew none other. These men of the viks or fjords rid the
coasts of Europe in the eighth and ninth centuries of every fear
except of themselves. Then they went westward to America.</p>

<p>There is a bolder note in their geographical tradition than in
aught that had been before. One catches the swing of the Atlantic
surges and the pulses of people at home there in the chapter,
“On the Situation of Countries,” which begins the chronicle
of the <i>Heimskring’la</i>: “It is said that the earth circle which the
human race inhabits is much cut asunder with bights and bays,
and that great seas run into the land from the outer ocean. Of
a certainty, it is known that a sea goes in at the Norva Sound
(Gibraltar) right up to the land of Jerusalem; and from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
sea, again, a long bay, which is called the Black Sea, goes off
to the northeast, and it divides the two World-Ridings, that is
to say, Asia on the east from Europe on the west. To the north
of the Black Sea lies Sweden the Great, or the Cold (Russia);
and this is reckoned by some as not less in size than the Great
Saracen Land, or even the Great Land of the Bluemen (the
Moors). And the northern parts of this Sweden are unpeopled,
by reason of the frost and the cold, just as the southern parts
of Blue-Land are waste because of the sun’s burning. Mighty
lordships are there in this Sweden, and people of manifold kind
and speech; there are giants and there are dwarfs—aye, and
Bluemen, and folk of many kinds and marvellous, and wild
beasts, and dragons wondrous great.”</p>

<p>When the pagan Northmen became Christians their ferocity
was moderated, and their spirit of enterprise, as it seemed, almost
extinguished. Their old contempt of the sea did not pass
into the veins of the peoples over whom for a time they had
dominion. Rather the confused and credulous views of the
churchmen became their own, henceforth occupying the entire
field of European thought. Adam of Bremen, eleventh-century
churchman, pictures the sea as his time conceived it—the old
forbidding canvas of classic legend framed with the icicles of
Gothic discovery.</p>

<p>Terra Firma, says Adam, is entirely surrounded by the infinite
and terrible ocean. The northern spaces of the deep are
covered with ice and darkness and this expanse is called the
frozen, glutinous, or darkling sea. It is stiff with salt and covered
with black ice, formed long before and so dry that it will
burn like peat.</p>

<p>The German bishop even borrows a tale from the Northmen
to engender terrors to which they had been stranger. Their
king, Harald Hardrada, the most daring of men, had reports
from Frisian mariners which caused him to set sail for the limits
of the earth. In the darkness he arrived at the North Pole—a
profound vortex into which the ebb tides were sucked and out
of which the flood tides were disgorged. His ship plunged
down into the boiling chaos, but the sea which took could also
give, and the outward heave of its vast bosom flung the vessel
back again beyond the clutch of the whirlpool.</p>

<p class="caption">ROARING FORTIES<br> <i>By</i> F. J. Waugh</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>As late as 1406 a chronicler tells of English ships, bound for
Bordeaux, which penetrated an unfrequented sea where four
vessels from Lynn were swallowed up in a whirlpool, which
thrice a day drew in and cast out the flood. When fishermen of
that time went a few miles from land they used only haaf-words—a
sea speech in which persons, animals, and things had
other names than what they bore ashore; so might they avoid
offense to whatever was astir in the deep.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to turn from the gloomy imaginings of the
West to Indian and Chinese legends of the Seven Seas. In the
quainter fancy that animates them, at least the note of fear is
missing. From the Puranas, Gerini has made these identifications:
The Sea of Salt Water surrounds India. The Sea of
Sugar Cane Juice surrounds Burma. The Sea of Wine surrounds
the Malay Peninsula. The Sea of Clarified Butter surrounds
the Sunda Archipelago. The Sea of Milk surrounds
Siam and Cambodia. The Sea of Curds or Whey surrounds
South China. The Sea of Fresh Water surrounds North China
and Mongolia.</p>

<p>Fear of the ocean, and above all of the Atlantic, is, however,
the distinctive note in mediæval Arab geography. This was
perhaps a native growth of the desert, and its spirit is in the
Koran passage which speaks of “black night upon the deep,
which wave on wave doth cover, cloud upon cloud, gloom upon
gloom.” Arab merchants and pilgrims ranged to the ends of
the Moslem world. Save Marco Polo, Ibn Batuta was the earth’s
greatest and most curious traveler. To the Arab port of Bassorah,
sailors from the Nile, the Mediterranean, and even the
China Sea brought the gossip of mankind. Yet a dread of the
deep sounds through the works of Arab geographers, as through
the saga of Sindbad, with the effect of a refrain.</p>

<p>Around the fair meadows of the world swung the terrible
ocean, the Sea of Darkness as the Arabs called it. To Massoudy
the Atlantic was the Green Sea of Gloom. None dwelt
there, none could sail there, none knew to what infinite distances
it reached. Ibn Khaldun described it as the boundless, impenetrable
limit of the west. Other lights of Islam spoke of the
whirlpools into which vessels were drawn, and argued that even
if sailors knew the direction of the winds they did not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
whither the winds would carry them; nor could they carry them
anywhere, for there was nowhere to go, and in the realms of
mist no prospect of getting back. Sane men would not attempt
a venture out of sight of land, said certain of the doctors. To
plan such a journey, it was asserted, was evidence of an unsound
mind; to embark upon it was ground for depriving a man
of his civil rights.</p>

<p>Idrisi, Mohammedan savant in the service of King Roger of
Sicily in the twelfth century and the greatest of Arab geographers,
utters the authoritative Arab word upon the sea: “The
ocean encircles the ultimate bounds of the inhabited earth, and
all beyond it is unknown. No one has been able to verify anything
concerning it, on account of its difficult and perilous navigation,
its great obscurity, its profound depth and frequent
tempests; through fear of its mighty fishes and its haughty
winds; yet there are many islands in it, some peopled, others
uninhabited. There is no mariner who dares to enter its deep
waters; or if any have done so, they have merely kept along its
coasts, fearful of departing from them.”</p>

<p>Whether this was in some part a literary convention—a gesture
of geography—or the expression of an unshakable dread,
the sentiment limited the service of Islam to mankind. The
Arab coasting trade had reached as far as China and as far
down the eastern side of Africa as Zanzibar. But this people,
so resourceful on land, never pushed their coasting adventures
around the Cape of Good Hope, as Prince Henry and his Portuguese
successors did from a farther north on the other side of
Africa. Nor did they attempt, as Columbus did, the crossing
of a great sea. Nor did they essay, as Magellan did, to prove
by a circumnavigation the rotundity of the earth on which their
own geographers had spoken with the clearest voices of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>A group of remarkable legends illustrates the later annals of
the western ocean and carries them on to the Columbian adventure.
Idrisi tells a story of the eight Deluded Folk, or Lisbon
Wanderers, who went out to sea when the wind blew from the
east and for more than a month were carried before it. They
reached an island supposed to be one of the Canaries, where
they found a people who spoke Arabic and who sent them back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
when a wind arose from the west. St. Brendan voyaged for
seven years among seven islands of the west, according to a
story widely circulated in the eleventh century. The tenth-century
tale of the island of the Seven Spanish Bishops who had left
Spain to escape Moslem rule was revived by a Portuguese ship
captain who claimed to have reached the island; but when Prince
Henry bade him go back for proofs, the romancer took refuge
in flight.</p>

<p>It may have been that the Phœnicians made atonement at last
for the fables of paralyzing fear which they had spread abroad,
and on the outer verge of the Old World in the days of their
decline left their secret as a legacy for the bold to profit from.
The scene is Corvo, westernmost of the Islands of the Sun, as the
Azores were called; and the passage, though from a Portuguese
writer of the seventeenth century, refers to events a generation
before the Columbian discovery. Says Manoel de Faria y
Souza: “On the summit of a mountain called the Crow was found
the statue of a man on horseback, without saddle, bareheaded,
the left hand on the horse’s mane, the right pointing to the west.
It stood on a slab of the same stone as itself; beneath it, on a
rock, were engraved some letters in an unknown language.”</p>

<p>One explanation of the legend is given by a traveler of the
last century, who said that the superstitious folk of the island
fancied they saw in a promontory which reaches far into the sea
the semblance of a person with his hand stretched out toward
the New World. This, they declared, was the work of Providence,
and Columbus read the sign aright. But the tale may
not so easily be interpreted and dismissed. A hoard of Carthaginian
coins, so runs a report which Humboldt accepts, was discovered
in Corvo in 1749; and there are other stories of equestrian
statues of Carthaginian design erected upon Atlantic
islands. Against the utter drama of the legend—the parting
gesture of good will of a bold and subtle race of ancient time—may
be set another legend, more in keeping with the superstition
and fears of the Middle Ages. This was no equestrian
statue pointing westward, if the Pizzani map of 1367 was to be
believed. It was the figure of a saint with his back to the sunset
and his outstretched hand warning mariners away from the unnavigable
seas behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>The monkish monument was the parable of a twilight time.
To the fifteenth century the deep was an eerie domain where the
creatures of pagan and Christian story couched upon the ocean
floor, showed their unholy shapes among the waves, chattered on
desert island strands, and wove their enchantments in the mists.
In the north the witches of Lapland raised storms and wrecked
the ships that passed their shores. To the south none might sail
beyond Cape Bojador on the African Gold Coast. Who did so
was turned from white to black, and never came back. There
the flaming sword of the sun was laid across the paths of the sea.
What was beyond it was boiling brine and air heated into a flame—a
landless firmament of water and a starless firmament of sky.</p>

<p>Looking westward, men cowered before visions of the Hand
of Satan, thrust upward from far horizons to drag ships into
the depths. Or “the wind that blows between the worlds” might
carry mariners away on a journey from which was no returning.
Or currents, setting always in one direction, might sweep them
into illimitable space. If the world was flat, one might sail off
its edge. If it was round, its very rotundity would present a
sort of mountain up which no ship could climb on the backward
voyage. As to the Atlantic races, the mediæval maps told one
what to expect. What chance of succor, or agreeable converse,
or a profitable traffic from spouting monsters, satyrs, sirens and
conch-blowing tritons? Could one warm his hands at the witch-fires
of the sea?</p>

<p>Out of these gray forebodings the ships of Columbus, with
one stout heart and many questioning ones aboard, sailed into
the unknown, as vessels move through the sluggish dark before
the dawn breeze springs up and the sky reddens toward sunrise.
Ere long the caravels were steering among isles fanned by soft
breezes and bathed in tropical sunshine, and naked, kindly peoples
were hailing the mariners as visitors from the skies. Morning
had broken at last upon the western ocean, and in its level
rays a path lay sparkling clear across the sea—the path of enterprise,
of conquest, of gold, the path of victorious dreams.
Along that highway hardy spirits soon would press on great
adventures. In the stead of ghost-ridden hearth-keepers, mumblers
of old fable, shrinkers from the outer surges, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
men who dared go round the earth in flimsy barks and lead a
handful of followers against the haughty empires of the
Cordilleras.</p>

<p>Terror was dead upon the deep. Somewhat of fable remained.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c19">Chapter XIX. The Sargasso Sea</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">If</span> there were no Sargasso Sea there would still have been a
legend of one to satisfy the demand of the mind, in a world of
change and motion, for a place where there was neither. Conscious
of the flight of time, noting the flow of rivers, the wind’s
wandering, and the climbing and falling of the waves of the
ocean, the mind has created realms where time stands still,
countries of morning calm and afternoon sunshine, and spaces
where the pulse of the sea is asleep. Peace there was in the
grave, but what was sought was a paradox—something alive and
yet motionless in time and space. There were stagnant pools
in the imagination, grotesqueries, junk heaps, a sense of silences
and of slow decay that was no decay at all but the serenity of
noon in a swamp. The outward symbol of these moods men
would have in the world about them.</p>

<p>For uncounted ages that symbol had been a fact of the mid-Atlantic.
People must have known of the Sargasso thousands of
years ago, though the memory of the voyages in which they
learned of it is no more, and the tales that seem to speak of it
are not accepted as facts. Plato had told of the thick waters
that rolled over the sunken Atlantis, preventing the passage of
ships. When Columbus entered this sea and saw tunny fish
playing about his caravels, he remembered a story of Aristotle
that certain ships of the Semites, coasting beyond the Pillars of
Hercules, were driven before a gale from the east until they
reached a weedy sea, resembling sunken islands, among which
were tunny fish. On his voyage to Britain Himilco reported that
he found vast fields of floating weeds which retarded his vessels
and brought them to danger.</p>

<p>The ancient view of the Atlantic was that it was a region of
baffling calms and shallow water and mud and seaweed. This
was based on Punic reports, and the Carthaginians told such
tales of the open seas as would frighten other nations from them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Yet their distorted statements had so much of truth intermixed
with error that it is hard to believe they intended altogether
falsely, and were vindicated only by coincidence when a grassy
sea, greater than their dominions at their widest, was found west
of the Azores. With flagrant exaggeration, however, they had
spoken of sea grasses with needle-like tops, a sort of marine
wheat with stalks as close together as in sheaves of grain. In
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 300 Theophrastus had written of wide-leaved weeds that
drifted from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean. In his poetic
account of the African west coast Festus Avienus described in
detail the weedy impediments to navigation, using, so he says,
the journals of Punic ships. Scylax recited that the sea beyond
Cerne on the coast of Mauretania could not be navigated “in
consequence of its shallowness, its muddiness, and its sea grass.”
With easy exuberance of fancy Lucian had told in his <i>True History</i>
of encountering a floating forest in the sea and of sailing
right over the tops of the trees toward “that continent which we
supposed lies opposite our own”—a reference which gains in
significance from its casual character.</p>

<p>Though most of them have been lost, there were strange Sargasso
legends in the ancient world, based on reports of floating
seaweed and the claims of captains that this had put them in
hazard. What weedy growths could do in restless water men
knew by observing their effects in rivers, notably on the upper
Nile. The envoys of Nero had been halted there by a sea of
floating vegetation; a long line of travelers thereafter had a like
experience, and a tragedy of this floating greenery is of our
own time. By the blocking of the Nile channel in 1880 Gessi
was held prisoner for three months with five companies of soldiers
and a multitude of freed slaves, and most of them died
before help came.</p>

<p>The burden of these old fables was of a stagnant death in
silent spaces of the sea where nothing ever happened. The
weedy continent was a trap which closed in upon ships and
suffered no escape, even though with double banks of oars the
rowers strove. Death claimed the crew, and slowly the sea
claimed the galleys. Marine plants crept over bow and stern
and writhed into the cabins and climbed the masts and swathed
all in a green decay; and silently, as the timbers parted below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and the weight of vegetation massed above, the vessel sank,
perhaps into some harbor of the lost Atlantis.</p>

<p>A prison for lost souls, the St. Brendan legend calls the
grassy sea of the west. The ferment was working in men’s
imaginations. There must be a spectral haven in the sea, a place
into which vessels might come, out of which they could not go.
For a while in the waters of the east this was the Island of Lodestone,
which drew and held to itself all craft that had iron
in their timbers. In Maundeville the legend of the Sargasso Sea
is full blown, though with him it is truth—travel truth—of a
magnetic rock.</p>

<p>“I myself,” he said, “have seen afar off in that Sea as though
it had been a great Isle full of Trees and Bush, full of Thorns
and Briars, great Plenty. And the Shipmen told us, that all that
was of Ships that were drawn thither by the Adamants, for the
Iron that was in them. And from the Rottenness and other
Things that were within the Ships, grew such Bush, and Thorns
and Briars and green Grass and such manner of Things, and
from the Masts and the Sail-yards it seemed a great Wood or
a Grove. And such Rocks be in many Places thereabouts. And
therefore dare not the Merchants pass there, but if they know
well the Passages, or else that they have good Pilots. And also
they dread the long Way more far by many dreadful Days’
journeys than Cathay.”</p>

<p>Thus the Port of Missing Ships came into view as the creation
of classic and mediæval legend, to which modern exploration
had given a sure place in the sea. It fulfilled a stagnant something
in the souls of men. It offered harbor to certain of their
dreams. It yielded a last resting place to derelicts that had
wandered far, among them the derelicts of fancy. It gave reply
to questions that arose whenever the argosies went out and did
not come back. Against the eternal restlessness and fated journeyings
of the Flying Dutchman it summoned up the picture of
a fated and eternal calm. It added to the terrors of the sea a
horror that was half poetry. This became poetry altogether
when men had ceased to believe and yet wanted to believe, and
in their art evoked the vision of ruinous hulks of Tyrian, Roman,
and Spanish ships side by side upon a spectral main, silent
witnesses of all the maritime adventures of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>The actuality behind the mask of legend, a vast expanse of
sea in the Atlantic, in many places resembling an inundated
meadow, Columbus discovered on his first voyage, when for
three weeks he traversed it. But instead of having misgivings,
he rejoiced at what he conceived to be evidence that land was
not far distant. On one of the floating weed masses he saw a
white tropical bird of a kind that does not sleep upon the sea.
His journal speaks little of the apprehensions of the sailors,
but his son Fernando recites these—their fears that the weeds,
which plainly retarded the ships, would halt them altogether;
that the marine growths might conceal the lurking rocks, shoals
and quicksands of a shallowing ocean; and that, run aground
or fatally entangled in gulfweed, the ships might rot and fall
apart far from any shore or any hope of aid. Memories of the
Atlantis legend raised in their minds the menace of drowned
lands and the monumental ruins of a lost continent.</p>

<p>To Columbus, however, the Sargasso Sea stood, not for a lost
continent, but for the boundary between the worlds. Where it
began, west of the Azores, the New World began also, and the
Old World ended. This was no theoretical meridian, he
thought, but a true physical line of demarcation drawn by nature
between the hemispheres. He could sense a difference in
climatic conditions in crossing the line, and the compass seemed
to show magnetic deviations. On his return he believed that
he could determine his longitude by observing the first floating
masses of tangled seaweed. So persuasive was his imaginative
force, so great his influence in Europe, that soon after his
arrival there the eastern boundary of the weedy sea became the
globe’s first, and last, political boundary of an all-embracing
kind. Title to newly discovered lands east of it was awarded
by a papal bull to Portugal. Title to newly discovered lands
west of it was awarded to Spain.</p>

<p>Oviedo gave this expanse the name of Sargasso Sea, from
Sargaço, the Portuguese word for seaweed. It was freely
traversed by the explorers who followed Columbus. The world-rounding
expedition of Drake reports that for five days “wee
sayled through the sea of Weedes, about the space of one hundred
leagues, being under the Tropicke of Cancer.” The size
and exact location of the sea were long a matter of conjecture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Varenius, for example, placed its northern limit opposite the
mid-Sahara and its southern opposite the Cape of Good Hope.
The note of Humboldt in his <i>Views of Nature</i>, published near
the middle of the nineteenth century, is the first scientific account
of it. This was based on rather scanty observations of English
and Dutch sailing vessels which took a course through it from
the West Indies to Europe. Humboldt thought the Sargasso
Sea comprised two weed banks, the larger one west of the
Azores, the smaller between the Bermudas and Bahamas, with
a transverse band connecting them. Fuller reports, since made
by steamers, with the careful records of the German Hydrographic
Office, have enabled scientists, and particularly Doctor
Krümmel, to correct these conclusions and plot the true outlines
of the sea.</p>

<p>The Equatorial Current sets west from the coast of Africa.
The Gulf Stream sets north and east from the Straits of Florida—still
following the direction, Donnelly ingeniously contended,
that was given it by the lost continent of Atlantis, around which
it flowed. The two currents, moving in nearly opposite directions,
impart a circular motion to the waters that lie between,
so that all things adrift over an area of millions of square miles,
seaweed, driftwood, and hulks of ships are drawn toward a
common center, which may be called the floating storehouse of
the North Atlantic. Banks of weed are found as far west as
the Bermudas, and this outer grassy sea covers an expanse of
about three million square miles, or as much as continental
United States. But the true Sargasso Sea of dead waters, where
gulfweed is found thickly, covers an area of about one million
two hundred thousand square miles, or the size of the Mississippi
Valley. It is an ellipse with the Tropic of Cancer as
its longer axis. The sea stretches through fifteen degrees of
latitude and more than twenty-five degrees of longitude, the two
foci of the ellipse being near 45° and 70° west.</p>

<p>With the shift of winds and calms the weedy sea itself shifts
somewhat, but its mean location remains unchanged. Humboldt
was convinced that in his time it was precisely where Columbus
had found it three and a half centuries before, and Maury’s
study of marine observations leads to the conclusion that there
has been no change in the last fifty years. Of all the larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
aspects of nature this is perhaps the only one that is just as it
was in the time of Columbus. During thousands of years, when
the ocean was battering at the coasts of the continents, breaking
down or building up the shore; when earthquakes and volcanoes
were causing islands to appear and disappear; when the wind
and rain were at their unending tasks of bearing everything terrestrial
into the deeps; and when races of men were remodeling
some small portions of the earth’s surface with roads and ports
and bridges, the Sargasso Sea may have been the only thing immune
from change. This eternal vortex might well be called
the true Navel of the World.</p>

<p>Even now, when many ships ply these waters, and after the
records of centuries seem to have assured that there are no
reefs or shoals under their greenery, travelers admit a sense of
uneasiness as their craft plunges into what seems a sunken
meadow. Nearer view, however, discloses that the patches of
vegetation are discontinuous. The larger single masses may be
several acres in extent, or may not be more than a hundred feet
across. The weeds commonly lie in long parallel rows that tail
to the prevailing winds. By noting the rows, the mariner can
tell whether the wind has been blowing steadily, or has recently
shifted, and in which direction. The lines are sometimes so
near together as to seem one mass, or they may be as far apart
as two hundred feet. In some places the weeds in them barely
touch, in others they are so crowded that their tops are thrust
a little distance above the water.</p>

<p>A distinctive fauna, sparse in species but unnumbered in individuals,
has been developed among these masses. The floating
berries are thickly incrusted with white polyzoa. About
sixty animal species peculiar to the area have been noted, among
them small fish, shrimps, crabs, molluscs, gastropods, and one
insect. The fishes have developed a strong protective resemblance
to the shapeless weeds among which they feed. Strangest
of these is the <i>Antennarius marmoratus</i>, a little creature not
more than four inches long and indistinguishable from a plant
spray. It seems half adapted for walking; its fins, which suggest
the extremities of four-footed creatures, have real toes, and
the front fins have the form of arms with elbows and fingered
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>The Prince of Monaco conducted a scientific expedition into
these waters in 1905, and in 1911 the United States Hydrographic
Service sent a party of scientists for a three months’
study of them; but adequate knowledge is still wanting.</p>

<p>There is a Sargasso question: How does the weed get into the
sea? The old theory was that it is a true oceanic plant. To
those who held to the belief in a sunken continent the grassy
domain was a sort of canopy suspended over it, the flying banners
of the lost Atlantis. There is still good scientific opinion
of which the French are the leaders, that the weed grows in the
area where it is found, reproducing itself by fissure, the parent
stem throwing off branches which multiply in turn. The bulk
of scientific opinion outside of France is that these meadows of
the sea are the spoil of the neighboring islands and continents.
The gulfweed which covers them, it is held, has been torn from
the shores of northern Brazil, of the West Indies, and of North
America as far as Cape Cod, and has drifted into this vortex—a
journey that may take almost half a year. The French contend
that even without these admitted contributions from America
there would still be a weedy sea about the Tropic of the Crab.</p>

<p>From time to time commercial enterprise has canvassed the
possibilities of a Sargasso adventure. It may be that a profitable
fishery will yet be established there with the Azores for
its base, and that the kelp will be converted into potash for fertilizer
or for gunpowder. Thus would the arts of war and peace
draw support from the sea, that, if legend speaks truly, sleeps
over the continent which spread them through the antediluvian
world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c20">Chapter XX. Atlantis</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Under</span> the Sargasso Sea, if a few accomplished thinkers, a
somewhat larger number of speculative scientists, and a host
of dreamers are right, lies the lost Atlantis. This legend of a
continent beyond the Pillars of Hercules, which reached a high
level of civilization, extended its rule along both shores of the
Mediterranean, sent its armies to battle with Egypt and Athens,
and “in a day and a fatal night” sank beneath the sea eleven
thousand years ago, is the most haunting and poignant thing
that has come down from antiquity.</p>

<p>The story derives from Plato, who attributes it to his relative,
Solon, who had it from a priest of Egypt. It is told briefly and
completely in the <i>Timæus</i> and with much greater detail in the
<i>Critias</i>; unfortunately, the latter portion of this work is wanting
and the narrative ends abruptly, before recounting the
cataclysm outlined in the earlier work. Both are built upon
the conversation between Solon and the Egyptian priest. Discoursing
on the ignorance of the Greeks concerning their own
history, the priest said that they knew nothing of a thing which
was preserved in the sacred books of the temple at Sais—that,
nine thousand years before, the Athenians had repelled an
invading force which threatened the conquest of Europe and
Asia. This force had come in through the Straits of Gibraltar
from the Atlantic Sea, “which was at that time navigable.”</p>

<p>Beyond the Straits, according to the <i>Timæus</i>, lay the island
of Atlantis, greater than Libya and Asia (Minor) together. Other
islands surrounded it, and farther west was a continent. Between
Atlantis and this continent rolled an ocean so great that,
compared with it, the land-locked Mediterranean was merely a
harbor. A powerful dynasty of kings arose on the island, subjugated
the surrounding archipelagoes and a part of the unnamed
continent beyond, and in the Old World swayed Libya
up to Egypt and the northern shore of the Mediterranean as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
as Tuscany. They undertook to complete their conquest of the
Mediterranean coasts, but the Athenians, though deserted by
their allies, beat off their ships. While the fleet from beyond
the Straits was still in the Inland Sea, it would seem, the island
of Atlantis was sunk, and the earthquakes that submerged it
and the monstrous waves that followed spread ruin all along
the Mediterranean shores.</p>

<p>Here is the passage in which Plato records the concluding
words of the priest of Solon: “But after (the battle) there occurred
violent earthquakes and floods, and in a single day and
night of rain all your warlike men in a body sunk into the earth,
and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared and was
sunk beneath the sea. And that is the reason why the sea in
those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is
such a quantity of shallow mud in the way; and this was caused
by the subsidence of the island.... There are remaining in
small islets only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be
called, all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen
away, and the mere skeleton of the country being left.”</p>

<p>The longer account in the <i>Critias</i> describes the civilization
of Atlantis. It begins, as all chronicles used to do, with the
affairs of the gods, and their amorous interest in the daughters
of men (<i>Gen.</i> vi: 2). The sea god Poseidon fell in love with
Cleito, a mortal island maiden, and she bore him five sets of
twins. The ten sons became kings, each ruler of a tenth part of
Atlantis, but all subject to the eldest son, Atlas. The capital
of the island became his abode, as it had been his mother’s before
him. Poseidon himself had laid out the palace compound,
making alternate zones of sea and land; “there were two of land
and three of water which he turned as with a lathe out of the
center of the island.”</p>

<p>At this point in the account, the divine figures disappear and
it becomes seemingly a straight historical narrative. Its picture
of the capital is more exact in its topographical, architectural,
and engineering detail than many that have come down to us
of the older capitals of Asia, or than any biblical picture of
Jerusalem. The laws, religion, and arts of the people are all
adequately noticed.</p>

<p>There was a barrier of lofty mountains around the shores of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
the island, their flanks sloping precipitously to the sea. In the
upland valleys were rich and populous villages. The middle
of the island was a great and fertile plain surrounded by a
ditch one hundred feet deep. Abundant rivers coursed the plain
and the moisture of the rainy season was supplemented in the
summer by a system of aqueducts. In the center of the plain
was a magnificent city.</p>

<p>Assuming that this is no dream geography, it is necessary
to determine the size of Atlantis, and in doing so to reconcile a
conflict of statements in Plato’s story. He speaks of it as a
large island, though small as compared with a land domain west
of it, which “may be most truly called a continent”; yet he says
Atlantis was larger than Libya and Asia combined. The tale
becomes incredible if Libya receives its common Greek extension
as the whole of Africa, and if Asia is taken in the larger
sense; for such an island there would not be room in the Atlantic.
The passage is brought into harmony with the context
if other ancient definitions are followed, so that Libya is made
to mean the district immediately west of Egypt and Asia to
mean Asia Minor. This would give the legendary Atlantis a
territory of perhaps three hundred thousand square miles, or
about twice that of the state of California.</p>

<p>There are precise figures for the great central plain and they
harmonize with such an estimate of the island area. The plain
was three hundred and forty miles long by two hundred and
thirty wide—in other words, exactly the size of the state of
Washington, but with its greater dimension from south to north.
The topography of the whole island suggests that of California,
although its shape was more compact. Its central plain lay
within its mountain barriers as the San Joaquin and Sacramento
valleys lie between the Sierras and the Coast Range. And in
its mineral riches, its mild climate, its system of irrigation, and
in the products of its fields, orchards, and vineyards it was very
like the Pacific coast state.</p>

<p>“Whatever fragrant things there are in the earth,” says Plato,
“whether roots or herbage or woods, grew and thrived in that
land.” He mentions melons—“fruits with a hard rind”—chestnuts,
and “the pleasant kinds of dessert which console us after
dinner when we are full and tired of eating,” which may mean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
among other things, grapes and oranges; and all these “the
sacred island lying beneath the sun brought forth fair and wondrous
in infinite abundance.” In this picture there is but one
unfamiliar figure. Herds of elephants roved there, where California
can show only the fossil remains of the mastodon.</p>

<p>In the account of the capital city it is illuminating to recur to
the Pacific state, for the metropolis of Atlantis lay in the midst
of a mountain-girdled plain, and yet, like Sacramento, had access
to the sea, in this case by a ship canal perhaps connecting
with a river. If one can imagine the buildings and grounds of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915 with the wharves and
commerce of San Francisco removed to Sacramento, one may
glimpse the legendary metropolis. In the center of the city,
on an artificial island, were temples and palaces like those of
the exposition, but of a barbaric splendor. Greatest of these
was the temple to Poseidon, a structure about as large as one of
the palaces surrounding the Court of the Universe at the exposition,
and doubtless of no greater height, for this was a region
of earthquake, and within the temple was one statue that reached
quite to the roof. Its walls were silvered, with gilded pinnacles,
and under the ivory roof the interior blazed with gold and silver
and “orichalcum”—copper, or an alloy of it, and esteemed next
to gold.</p>

<p>The wall that encircled this inner island or citadel “flashed
with the red light of orichalcum.” There was a broad canal
around it, and then an encircling zone of land, about which was
a wall sheeted with tin. Around this was still another canal encircled
by another land zone, and here was a wall coated with
brass, beside which ran a racecourse two hundred yards wide
where horses contended. Encircling this again was the outermost
canal. Beyond it lay the city.</p>

<p>The buildings of the outer city, as well as those of its sacred
citadel, were of stones in three colors—white, black and red—which,
with all the minerals useful to man, were taken from the
bosom of the island. There were hot and cold springs, with
baths and with pools for horses and cattle; the surplus water
was conveyed by aqueducts to the grove of Poseidon. Around
the harbor front were docks, triremes, and naval stores. Back
of them the plain was densely crowded with habitations. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
harbors were full of vessels, and merchants coming from all
parts who from their numbers kept up “a multitudinous sound of
human voices and din of all sorts night and day.”</p>

<p>A copper column stood in the temple of Poseidon, on which
the laws of the land were graven. The chief of these were that
the people should not take up arms against one another, and
that they should all come to the rescue if anyone in any city attempted
to overthrow the royal house. On the plain and in the
populous mountain valleys there was a system of military service
by districts and chiefs of districts, somewhat like that of
ancient Peru; and when Atlantis went to war ten thousand
chariots moved in front of its armies, and twelve hundred vessels
swept the sea lanes east and west. It was a powerful nation and
a happy—so long as the divine nature of their founder retained
its force among the people. Says Plato:</p>

<p>“They despised everything but virtue, not caring for their
present state of life and thinking lightly on the possession of
gold and other property which seemed only a burden to them;
neither were they intoxicated by luxury; nor did wealth deprive
them of their self-control; but they were sober and saw clearly
that all these goods are increased by virtuous friendship with
one another, and that by excessive zeal for them, and honor of
them, the good of them is lost and friendship perishes with
them.”</p>

<p>At length, however, the divine nature in the Atlantines became
diluted by mortal admixture. They were filled with avarice,
pride, the lusts of the flesh; and “the fairest of their precious
gifts” departed from them. Base to men of insight, they still
appeared to others as glorious and blessed. In order to effect
their chastisement and correction, says Plato, returning to the
mythological vein, a council of the gods was called, and Zeus
“spoke as follows.” What the Olympian said will never be
known, for here the <i>Critias</i> ends, and for the fate of the Atlantines
one must recur to the <i>Timæus</i>.</p>

<p>The mythical prologue and epilogue excepted, the whole account
reads as if the author believed it himself. It is singularly
free from fantasy—this is no Cloud-Cuckoo Land of an Aristophanes.
The transcriber of the legend was perhaps the largest
mind of antiquity and a man of unblemished character; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
“strange but altogether true” he calls his own story. He was,
however, a constructive dreamer, and in his <i>Republic</i> he has
given a detailed sketch of an ideal state. Was this another
essay of a like nature? Might not the narrative carry further
if it came from a man of less imaginative sweep—from the contemporary
Xenophon, or from Plutarch, both of them vivacious
chroniclers with their eyes on facts? Phædrus had said to Socrates,
“You can easily invent a tale of Egypt.” Has the great
disciple of Socrates done this?</p>

<p>These questions are asked still, and antiquity asked them.
Proclus in his commentary on the <i>Timæus</i> assumed that the legend
was a symbol of the contest between the primeval forces and
the spirit of art and science; he recites that Crantor, the first
commentator, accepted it as literal history and was ridiculed
for it. Strabo and Pliny barely mention the story. Thus Plutarch
sets down the circumstances of its relation: “Solon attempted
in verse a large description, or rather fabulous account
of the Atlantic Island, which he had learned from the wise men
of Sais; but by reason of his age he did not go through with it.
Plato laid out magnificent courts and inclosures, and erected a
grand entrance to it, such as no other story, fable, or poem ever
had. But he began it late, he ended his life before the work,
so that the more the reader is delighted with the part that is
written, the more regret he has to find it unfinished.”</p>

<p>There is evidence that at any rate the legend is not an invention
of Plato. It was claimed by Plato himself that the victory
of the Athenians over the Atlantines was depicted on one of the
ceremonial tunics which were borne in the midsummer festival
of the Panathenæa. Diodorus has a reference to this war.
Ælian says that Theopompus heard a similar story in Phrygia,
in which, however, the island was called Meropis. Proclus
quotes from the <i>Æthiopica</i> of Marcellus a tale of ten islands
in the outer sea, the inhabitants of which preserved the memory
of a large island that had ruled over the archipelago and was
sacred to Poseidon.</p>

<p>The following are the main explanations, ancient and modern,
of the legend: 1. Atlantis was no island, but a part of either
Europe or Africa—the Iberian peninsula, or Senegal, for example—so
remote from Egypt as to seem an island to mariners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
who reached it after beating about beyond the Straits. 2. Atlantis
was Minoan Crete, resembling Plato’s island in its configuration
if not in its site; the ancient Cretan civilization was
destroyed about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 1500, almost as completely as if by a
submergence in the sea. 3. “Atlantis is too obviously an earlier
and equally colossal Persia, western instead of eastern.” 4. Atlantis
is pure fiction, arising, like the tales of Homer and Hesiod,
in the belief that the abodes of the heroes were in the extreme
west. 5. Atlantis is a variant of the old tradition of a Golden
Age. 6. Atlantis and the Fortunate Islands and the Azores are
one, but tradition placed them too near the Straits, and the
legend of a great sunken island arose when no land was found
where people thought land should be. 7. Atlantis is another
form of the solar myth—the setting of the sun in the red ruin
of evening, and the coming of dark upon the deep. 8. Atlantis
and the Republic are companion realms, the one no less imaginary
than the other, and each intended to illustrate Plato’s conception
of ideal polity.</p>

<p>These are the conjectures of a skepticism which properly refuses
to believe that so great a thing has happened and left such
slight traces in monuments or in tradition. Yet there are some
details in Plato’s story not so easily disposed of, and they appear
more distinctly when Atlantis itself is erased from it.
These are the islands on both sides of the legendary continent,
the impassable sea that covers its site, the great ocean beyond it,
and the continent in the west which hems in that ocean. None
of these things the men of Plato’s time knew of, but, to give
them their modern names, they seem to be Madeira, the Canaries,
the Cape Verde Islands and the Azores on the one side
of the Sargasso Sea, the West Indies on the other, the Sargasso
Sea itself, the open Atlantic, and the American continent.</p>

<p>If the classic world had few and faint traditions of a sunken
continent and ignored them or dismissed them as idle tales, it
had one overmastering feeling that could not be called a superstition
because it never took a tangible form. The feeling was
a blind terror of the Atlantic Ocean, as if something dreadful
had happened there, but so long before that nobody knew what
it was.</p>

<p>Nothing has developed in Europe itself that makes Plato’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
story of a lost continent a whit more probable or less plausible
than it was when he wrote it; but there have been contributions
to the legend from the ocean floor and from the New World.
The variations, and in a measure the shifts, of opinion on the
Atlantis story in the last hundred years are represented by three
names—Humboldt, Ignatius Donnelly, and Pierre Termier.
Writing in 1826, the German savant noted evidences of an external
influence in the historical monuments of Central America.
In his book, <i>Atlantis: The Antediluvian World</i>, Donnelly boldly
contended that a continent had disappeared in the mid-Atlantic,
that this sunken domain had been the cradle of civilization, and
that the widespread traditions of a deluge were race memories
of its disappearance. This writer’s identification with the Baconian
cipher theory, and his espousal of fanciful beliefs and
lost causes, political or other, together with his credulity and
his snap judgments, obscured the industry, the wide range of
information, and the real gift of generalization to which his
book bore witness. It came with something like a shock to the
scientific world when the French scholar, Prof. Pierre Termier,
Director of the Geological Survey of France, read his paper on
Atlantis before the Oceanographic Institute of France in 1912.
This was published at Monaco in the Bulletin of the Institute of
Oceanography in 1913, and a translation, included in the annual
report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1915, provoked a discussion
among geographers in America that continued for several
years.</p>

<p>“It seems more and more evident,” concluded Termier, “that
a vast region, continental or made up of great islands, has collapsed
west of the Pillars of Hercules, and that its collapse occurred
in the not distant past.”</p>

<p>In support of this inference Termier arrays the evidence of
the Atlantic’s surface and of the floor which its waters conceal.
A ship sailing due west from the Straits of Gibraltar four thousand
miles to Cape Hatteras would meet with no land. But if
it lengthened its course a little by making a detour, first toward
the southwest, then toward the northwest, then again toward the
southwest, it would bring in view Madeira, the more southern
Azores, and the Bermudas. And if it took soundings it would
discover that, the marine depths over which it was passing were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
strangely unequal. If the ocean were drained dry, what would
be seen would be a long elevated region lying between the Old
and New Worlds, separated from both by two enormous valleys,
the wider and deeper one on the American side. This is the
revelation of oceanography—a hidden continent in the Atlantic
basin with the islands named above as its mountain peaks.</p>

<p>Geology adds that the eastern region of the Atlantic over all
its length and probably from pole to pole is a great volcanic
zone. “Everywhere,” says the French geologist, “earthquakes
are frequent, here and there islets may spring up abruptly from
the sea, or rocks long known may disappear.” The ocean may
conceal the continuity of these changes, but to geological science
they are incontestable and they affect a zone which reaches from
Iceland to the Cape Verde Islands and is about 1,875 miles
broad.</p>

<p>When a ship was laying the cable between Brest and Cape
Cod in 1898, the cable broke and was recovered by grappling.
The grappling irons encountered various submerged rocks with
hard points and sharp edges, and brought to the surface fragments
of the vitreous lava called tachylyte. These “precious
fragments,” as Termier calls them, are in the Museum of the
School of Mines in Paris. The significance of their structure
is that if they had solidified under water they would have been
composed of confused crystals. In the form in which they were
found they must have cooled when they were still above the
sea’s surface. The sharp edges of the marine rocks, whence these
fragments came, argue that the region collapsed suddenly and
recently. Had they remained after the volcanic disturbance a
long time above the sea, they would have been smoothed by
atmospheric erosion. Had they been a long time under the
sea, they would have been smoothed by marine abrasion. The
inference is that “the entire region north of the Azores and
perhaps the very region of the Azores, of which they may be
only the visible ruins, was very recently submerged, probably
during the epoch which the geologists call the present, because
it is so recent, and which for us, the living beings of to-day, is
the same as yesterday.”</p>

<p>The evidence of zoölogy has been arrayed by another French
scholar, M. Louis Germain, briefly as follows: The present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
fauna of the Azores, Madeira, the Canaries, and Cape Verde
Islands originated in Africa; the Quaternary formations of the
Canaries resemble those of Mauretania and inclose the same
species of mollusca. Therefore these archipelagoes were connected
with Africa up to an epoch near our own, at the very
least until toward the end of the Tertiary. Among the present
mollusca of the archipelagoes are some species which seem to
be survivors of the European Tertiary. Therefore there was a
bond between the islands and Spain which was severed during
the Pliocene. The <i>Pulmonata mollusca</i>, called oleacinidæ, are
found only in Central America, the West Indies, the Mediterranean
Basin, and the Canaries, Madeira, and the Azores, and
are larger in America than in these other regions. Therefore
the continent which included these islands had extended to the
West Indies at the beginning of the Miocene, but had been separated
from them during the Miocene. Fifteen species of marine
mollusca lived at the same time both in the West Indies
and on the coast of Senegal, and nowhere else. Therefore until
very near the present time a maritime shore extended from the
West Indies to Senegal.</p>

<p>The arguments of geology and zoölogy may be combined.
Termier is of those geologists who believe the ancient alignment
of continents was east and west instead of north and south.
There was a North Atlantic continent comprising Russia, Scandinavia,
Great Britain, Greenland and Canada, and later a
large part of central and western Europe and of the United
States. There was also a South Atlantic or African-Brazilian
continent extending northward to the Atlas, eastward to the Persian
Gulf, westward to the Andes. Between the two continents
was the Mediterranean depression, the ancient maritime furrow
still marked in the present Mediterranean and Caribbean seas.
These continents were broken up by foldings and collapses and
a new design appeared, the general direction of which is from
north to south.</p>

<p>M. Germain, confining himself mainly to the middle region
between these two supposed continental areas, infers the existence
of an Atlantic continent connected with Spain and Morocco
and prolonging itself so far south as to take in regions of desert
climate. During the Miocene this continent reaches the West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
Indies. It is then broken up and portioned off, at first in the
direction of the West Indies; then in the south, by the establishment
of a marine shore which reaches Senegal; then in the
east, probably during the Pliocene, along the coast of Africa.
“The last great fragment, finally engulfed and no longer having
left any further vestiges than the four archipelagoes, would be
the Atlantis of Plato,” says Termier, himself reviewing the conclusions
of Germain.</p>

<p>Thus the geological and zoölogical arguments correspond
very closely. To Termier there is no doubt at all that until
an epoch near our own there was a continental domain in the
Atlantic west of the Pillars of Hercules, and that it was sunk
in a cataclysm. There is only one question left: “Did men then
live who could withstand the reaction and transmit the memory
of it?” Geology and zoölogy have perhaps told all they could
tell by way of answer. “It is from anthropology, from ethnography,
and lastly from oceanography,” says Termier, “that
I am now awaiting the final answer.”</p>

<p>Anthropology and ethnography have provided some hints,
such as they are. Men of scientific or of speculative cast have
noted cranial and other correspondences in the subtropics on
both sides of the Atlantic, and what seemed to be African influences
in the civilizations of Central and South America. Quatrefages
named five races of American Indians which seemed to
him “true negroes.” Le Plongeon remarked the thick lips and
woolly hair of certain sculptured figures at Chichen Itza. Retzius
thought there were the same form of skull and the same
reddish-brown complexion in the Carib Islands and in the Canaries.
Elephant heads with trunk and tusks have been discovered
in the friezes of ruined temples in Yucatan. Wiener
contends, on the evidence of philology, that yams, manioc, peanuts
and tobacco came to America from Africa before Columbus
rather than went out from America afterward.</p>

<p>In ancient times the people of the Old World and the New
were in contact. The belief has been that this was across the
Pacific, but the traditions of Mexico and its neighbors point in
a different direction.</p>

<p>Two dominant notes are struck in the legends of the races
fronting on the Caribbean. One is the belief that civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
was brought to them by white, bearded strangers who came over
the sea from the east. The other is the tradition of a deluge
or related cataclysm. And sometimes the two stories are
grouped; the beneficent strangers are refugees from the disastrous
something that had happened upon the sea. Cataclysm
has been called the pivot of Central American myth and the
basis of the Mexican calendar.</p>

<p>The legendary founder of the oldest Mexican civilization, the
Toltec, was Quetzalcoatl, who was worshiped as a god, but was
reputed to have been a bearded white man who came from the
east with a band of colonists and instructed the natives in the
arts and sciences; his symbol was a boat. The story was that he
was driven out by the witch doctors, but promised to return.
Aztec belief that the Cortes expedition was the return visit made
easier the Spanish conquest. Among the Mayas the divine
stranger was known as Kukulcan, and his title was Lord of the
Hollow Tree (the ark?). Coming from “Valum Chvim,” he
founded the ancient city of Palenque. His company was described
as wearing black mantles with short sleeves; the Mayas
called them “men with petticoats.”</p>

<p>Native legends of tropic America, some of which Spence has
marshaled, present a panorama of flood, fire, hilltops of refuge,
arks, survivors. According to the Arawaks of Guiana the world
was smitten by fire, from which men hid themselves in caverns;
and then by flood, from which a leader and his followers saved
themselves in canoes. In the Carib deluge myth men escaped
to the mountain tops. In the Tupi-Guarani myth the Creator
scourged the world with fire but a great magician put it out
with a rainstorm and men took to trees (boats?). In the Karaya
myth an evil spirit invoked the deluge and sent fish to pull the
survivors down from the hill Tupimare. Various hills in Mexico
and the American southwest are pointed out as the Ararats
of flood refugees. There is even an account in the Nahuatl language
of the building of an ark. According to early Spanish
writers there were similar stories of oceanic upheaval among the
natives of the Antilles.</p>

<p>All the New World flood myths, the Chaldean, Aramæan, and
Iranian, the Hebrew story of Noah, and the Greek story of
Deucalion, as well as the indicated ending of Plato’s tale of Atlantis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
agree in their main lines—that a malevolent spirit
sought to drown all men, or that an angered divinity sought by
a deluge to punish their lusts and pride, and that a few righteous
or lucky men escaped. One of these stories, recited in the
sacred book of the Quiche Indians of Guatemala, was believed
by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg to be an account of the disaster
to Atlantis. As the briefest of the flood myths, and not the
worst, it may be repeated:</p>

<p>“They did not think or speak of the Creator who had created
them, and who had caused their birth. They were drowned, and
thick resin fell from heaven.</p>

<p>“The bird Xecotcovach tore out their eyes; the bird Camulatz
cut off their heads; the bird Cotzbalam devoured their flesh;
the bird Tecumbalam broke their bones and sinews and ground
them into powder.</p>

<p>“Because they had not thought of their mother and father, the
Heart of Heaven whose name is Hurakan, therefore the face
of the earth grew dark and a pouring rain commenced, raining
by day, raining by night.</p>

<p>“Then all sorts of beings, little and great, gathered together
to abuse the men to their faces; and all spoke, their millstones,
their plates, their cups, their dogs, their hens,” denouncing them
and railing at them.</p>

<p>These traditions of disaster, survival, and immigration are
the collateral support of native American myth to Plato’s narrative
of Atlantis. The monumental ruins of Central America
yield some evidence which in no wise confirms the traditions,
but into which they fit. The Maya civilization has been described
as immigrant from a region unknown. Its palaces and
temples and columns, and the figures and inscriptions upon
them, represent an art that seemingly had reached its maturity
when the earliest of them was made. There are no local evidences
of the slow evolution of skill and taste, such as would
be expected in an indigenous culture. The resemblances to the
monuments of Burmah and Siam are superficial. The evidences
of a European influence are practically <i>nil</i>. The indications of
a civilization remarkable along certain lines are convincing;
the Mexican calendar, the Maya astronomy, betray a knowledge
of the movements of the heavenly bodies which was equal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
that of Europe in the Columbian period, and yet independent
of it.</p>

<p>The Maya monuments have one singularity which has challenged
speculation. “It has been found,” says Spence, “that
the starting point of all the dates found on the monuments, save
two, is the same. Thus all Maya reckoning dates from one definite
day in the past, a day 3,000 years prior to the first date in
Maya history which can be described as contemporary with the
monument upon which it is found. Upon this practically all
Maya scholars of repute are agreed.” It has been conjectured
that this normal date of the Mayas is the date of a cataclysm,
somewhat as the people of San Francisco, with the memory of
their earthquake and conflagration strong in them, date many
events in their conversation as since the Fire. It has also been
conjectured that this date, and a developed civilization, were
brought to the Mayas by the survivors of the cataclysm.</p>

<p>Such is the case for Atlantis as it has been made up by men
with some rank as students or specialists. The bold guesses of
Donnelly, from whose work several of these citations have been
taken, must be added. His most interesting contention, perhaps,
is that the Bronze Age in Europe must have been preceded
by a Copper Age, since bronze is an alloy of copper and tin;
but that there is no evidence of a Copper Age in Europe. There
was, however, a Copper Age in America, from Bolivia to Lake
Superior, and therefore Atlantis was the bridge between the
Copper Age of America and the Bronze Age of Europe.</p>

<p>With a characteristic sweep of statement Donnelly announces
his conclusions. The people of Atlantis “were the founders of
nearly all our arts and sciences; they were the parents of our
fundamental beliefs; they were the first civilizers, the first navigators,
the first merchants, the first colonizers of the earth; their
civilization was old when Egypt was young, and they had passed
away thousands of years before Babylon, Rome, or London was
dreamed of. This lost people were our ancestors, their blood
flows in our veins; the words we use every day were heard, in
the primitive form, in their cities, courts, temples. Every line
of race and thought, of blood and belief, leads back to them.”</p>

<p>For every fact, tradition, or coincidence which seems to point
toward the disappearance of a continent in the Atlantic sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
there are other explanations with authoritative names behind
them. The old dread of the Western Ocean is attributed to the
teaching of primitive religions that there was the land of shades,
and to the colossal trickery of Phœnician mariners who wanted
no competitors beyond the Pillars. The American legends of
bright-faced strangers coming over the water from the east are
declared to be still another form of the sun myth. The world-wide
tradition of a deluge may represent the independent thinking
of various races of men who found fossil shells on their hillsides
and reasoned that at some time a sea had covered them.
It is asserted that Termier assumed too much for his specific
evidence of a recent submersion—the fragments of tachylyte
dredged from the ocean floor—when he declared that vitreous
lava could not form under the sea. Accepting, as many
geographers do, that a great land domain has sunk near the
coast of Africa, they say that this was not a historic, nor a prehistoric,
but a geologic event.</p>

<p>The controversy reduces itself, at last, to a question of time:
Did the large island which Plato called Atlantis disappear after
men came upon the earth? Termier does not assert this, but
thinks it possible, and in some measure the wish is father to
the thought. As an American geographer puts it, “It is well
known that Professor Termier is not only a good geologist, but
also a great lover of the beautiful and much given to the poetic
in speaking and writing.” This passage in the Termier address
is in point:</p>

<p>“Meanwhile not only will science, most modern science, not
make it a crime for all lovers of beautiful legends to believe in
Plato’s story of Atlantis, but science herself through my voice
calls their attention to it. Science herself, taking them by the
hand and leading them along the wreck-strewn ocean shores,
spreads before their eyes, with thousands of disabled ships, the
continents submerged or reduced to remnants, and the isles
without number enshrouded in the abyss.”</p>

<p>Beyond the appeal to poetry the Atlantis legend has another—an
appeal which is also a temptation. It explains much, perhaps
too much. There are gaps in the story of human origins,
and in the history of the arts and sciences, that are as wide as
the black voids the astronomer sees in the skies. Atlantis fills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
them all. Science has sought to fill them by assumptions—the
origin of man in a drowned continent of the Pacific called
Lemuria, of which Australia is a fragment; the origin of civilization
on the Mediterranean floor when it was dry land. These
are assumptions without a tradition behind them. Paradoxically
enough, the point of attack upon the Atlantis theory is that
a legend supports it, and other legends fit into it. The whole
matches into an ingenious and simple design, and are the affairs
of nature and man ever so simple?</p>

<p>It is not for anyone to answer yet, perhaps ever. But one
has license from Termier to speculate, and, if one will, to dream.
If in substance Plato’s tale was true, it needs no effort of imagination
to picture the empire of Atlantis as it was eleven thousand
years ago, for all its drama save the dreadful end has been
repeated. The British Isles, with their sea-borne commerce,
their Mediterranean and Caribbean garrisons, their mines
and metal workings, their ancient Druidical religion and costume,
even their addiction to horse-racing, reproduce in the
northern seas the story of this vanished island dominion south
and west of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The outlines of the crowning calamity of history—if history
it was—have already been drawn by legend, and there are authentic
human experiences on a lesser scale, and in other times
and places, to fill in the canvas. In the European port nearest
the supposed site of Atlantis, on the first day of November,
1775, a sound of thunder was heard underground, and in an
earthquake that shook twelve million miles of sea and land the
city of Lisbon fell in ruins, burying sixty thousand persons
beneath it.</p>

<p>“About one o’clock in the afternoon”—it is Pliny the Younger
speaking, the place is near Pompeii, and the time August 24th,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 79—“a vast and singular cloud was seen to elevate itself in
the atmosphere. It spread horizontally, in form like the
branches of the pine, and precipitated the burning materials
with which it was charged upon the many lovely but ill-fated
villages which stood upon this delightful coast.... Multitudes
crowded toward the beach, but the boisterous agitation
of the sea, alternately rolling on the shore and thrown back by
the convulsive motion of the earth, precluded every possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
of escape.... Now were heard the shrieks of women, screams
of children, clamors of men, all accursing their fate and imploring
death, the deliverance they feared, with outstretched
hands to the gods whom many thought about to be involved together
with themselves in the last eternal night.”</p>

<p>Let the biblical account of the deluge speak the closing word
upon Atlantis: “And all the high hills that were under the whole
heaven were covered, and the waters prevailed upon the earth.”</p>

<p>One turns from the convulsion and welter of the deep, and
the beautiful and dreadful thing that lay beneath it, and fixes
the gaze on archaic ships, laden with strangely robed men and
women, riding the long billows of the Caribbean toward a quiet
shore. There—if the dreamers are right—they built another
civilization, which flourished and in turn vanished, with its temples
and palaces, beneath the green mantle of the tropic forest.
If the dreamers are right.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c21">Chapter XXI. The Gilded Man</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> high plateau of Cundinamarca in the interior of Colombia
was once an inland sea. Its vestiges remain in small
lakes which the Indians held sacred, and into which they cast
offerings of emeralds and golden ornaments. There was a special
ceremony at Lake Guatavitá. When a cacique died and
another was chosen, a long procession moved down to the shore.
At the head went mourners, nude and wailing, their bodies
stained with red ochre. Behind them were other groups in
jaguar skins, their hair dressed with feathers, their limbs agleam
with barbaric jewelwork. Amid the joyful tumult of horns and
pipes followed the priests in tall black caps and long black
robes. In the rear came high priests and nobles carrying a barrow
hung with disks of gold. Upon the barrow rode El Dorado—the
Gilded Man—newly chosen chief of an obscure native
tribe, and destined to become, through no quality of his own,
the elusive central figure in the most singular chapter in exploration,
above all others the figure of fate in South America.</p>

<p>He was well named, with the poetry wherewith Spain had
invested the very headlands and harbors that her sons had found
in the west. Like the mourners, the Gilded Man was naked, and
yet he was clad. His body had been rubbed with fragrant gums,
and priests with tubes had blown gold dust over him, until he
gleamed like the god of day incarnate. Arrived at the shore,
the enameled chief went upon a raft with his cortège and was
ferried to the middle of the lake. There he plunged in and
laved himself while the people shouted and the trumpets brayed
on the beach. The golden dust that had covered him glimmered
down through the water as an offering to its deity. In
its wake followed the bracelets and brooches which the attendant
lords flung into the pool. So the ceremony ended.</p>

<p>This rite, beautiful and significant, is history, and not baseless
legend. Golden ornaments have been uncovered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
lake, which was drained by modern treasure-seekers; among
them was a piece wrought with some art which seems to be a
representation of the sacred raft and its passengers. Humboldt
thinks that the rite came from warmer regions and that the nude
figures and coronation bath are alien to the climate of the tableland.
But the fatal feature of the ceremony is that it was already
history when the Spaniards heard of it. The Muysca
Indians of the Bogota region subjugated the Muysca Indians of
the Guatavitá region about the time of the discovery of America.
The custom of bathing a gilded cacique passed with this small
tribal conquest. The memory of it remained. Unique among
the customs of the continent, it was talked of along the coasts
of the Caribbean when the Spaniards came. There were rumors
of it in Peru, and even farther south.</p>

<p>“Let us go in search of that gilded Indian,” said Belalcazar
when a native of the north brought the first news of him to
Quito, which had fallen to Pizarro a few years before. The
Spaniards went, and found all there was to find—the deep
waters of Guatavitá. But this did not content them. The Gilded
Man was a symbol. He stood for something larger than a rite
that might take place once in a generation. He stood for the
very arrogance and folly of a royal and a priestly wealth that
must be beyond measure. Every sunrise the body of the
haughty savage was covered afresh with glittering dust. Every
sunset, so the Spaniards fabled, he cleansed himself in a pool,
the bottom of which had slowly paved itself with gold, as generation
after generation of his dynasty performed their ablutions.
Only a mighty nation and a rich could have so prodigal a
king; and so El Dorado came to mean not so much a man as a
golden city in a gilded land. The altars and ewers and basins
of its temples, the furnishings and plate of its palaces, the jewels
and table service of its nobles—here was promise of a booty to
match the loot of Mexico and Peru.</p>

<p>In seeking it Spain spent more lives and sank more treasure
than in all its conquests in the New World.</p>

<p>Somehow the land that held it seemed to recede as the exploring
columns advanced. It was sought in Colombia, in Venezuela,
in eastern Peru, in northwestern Brazil, in Bolivia, and
from Paraguay. Over a great inverted triangle the base of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
which was a line nearly a thousand miles long drawn east from
the Cordilleras of Colombia nearly to the mouth of the Orinoco,
and the apex of which was in Paraguay two thousand miles to
the south, ceaselessly marched the expeditions. The El Dorado
country of the exploring parties—the region which knew their
tread—was thus a territory of about a million square miles. It
repeated the general lines of the continent itself, an enclave of
illusion surrounded by the realities of mountain and coast.</p>

<p>Into this triangle from all sides struck the Spanish columns.
They moved east, north, and south from Quito, south from the
Caribbean, south and west from Trinidad, north from Asuncion.
They climbed mountains, forded rivers, penetrated deserts.
They froze in the passes of the Andes, sickened in the
flooded, fever-haunted valley of the Amazon, died of hunger in
the pathless plains; and everywhere the poisoned Indian arrows
found their targets. Three of the columns, one of which had
been on the road for five years, entered the plateau of Cundinamarca
at the same time—a coincidence without parallel in history.
Germans and Englishmen also essayed the adventure. As
for Spain, when de Silva appealed for funds and followers, the
country could have been depopulated, says Padre Simon, so
strong was the belief in the Gilded Land.</p>

<p>Under the fable of the Gilded King ran other delusions. It
was thought that the northern part of South America was rich in
the precious metals. It was thought that the auriferous steeps
of Peru and New Granada swept eastward almost to the mouth
of the Orinoco. There was no comprehension of the continental
extent of intertribal trade, and the presence of gold among
Indian tribes was thought to be proof that it could be had in
their country, even when this was flat prairie or inundated
forest. Native traders followed their own path from the Andes
to the Caribbean; it is significant that the site of the legendary
city moved along it through successive generations almost from
end to end.</p>

<p>The search for it falls into four chapters—the quest of
El Dorado of Cundinamarca; the quest of El Dorado of Canelas;
the quest of El Dorado of the Omaguas; the quest of El Dorado
of Manoa.</p>

<p>By the chance meeting of three expeditions, already noted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
the end of the quest for El Dorado of Cundinamarca is sheer
pageantry. Belalcazar, lieutenant of Pizarro and governor of
Quito, had sent his captains in 1535 to discover what he conceived
to be a golden valley between Pasto and Popayan in the
Cordilleras of southern Colombia, not far from the South Sea.
The following year he undertook the search in person and
pushed it farther north to the plateau of Bogota. There he
found two other expeditions already in contact. Quesada had
started from Santa Marta with eight hundred men and a hundred
horses. With this command he had subjugated the Chibcha
nation, numbering a million persons if the chroniclers are right,
and dispersed an army of twenty thousand men which they had
put in the field. After difficult marching and fighting he brought
a handful of men—a hundred foot and sixty horse—to the
neighborhood of Bogota. Soon he saw approach the remnants
of an expedition which had left the coast of Venezuela five years
before. The German, Federmann, brought to the plateau a
hundred ragged men out of the four hundred well-equipped
soldiers with whom he had started.</p>

<p>The three commands bivouacked almost within striking distance
of each other. They presented a spectacular contrast, for
the men from Peru were in Spanish steel and scarlet, those from
Santa Marta wore Indian fabrics, while the men from Venezuela
were clad in the skins of wild animals. The clergy labored
feverishly to avert the expected appeal to arms, and for once in
the history of New World exploration resolute men of the
Iberian strain settled their differences without fighting. The
three captains went back to Spain together where each laid his
claim to the governorship of New Granada before the throne.
Only Belalcazar was recognized and he only with the post of
Adelantado in the Popayan region.</p>

<p>The quest of El Dorado of Canelas is the story of the expedition
of Gonzalo Pizarro and the secession therefrom of his lieutenant,
Orellana. Across all the history of Spanish exploration
flashes the treacherous and brilliant deed of Orellana, somewhat
as the “moving equator”—the Amazon—which he discovered,
cuts across the meridians of longitude between the Andes and
the Atlantic. Canelas was the Land of Cinnamon, and here, and
here only upon the soil of America, the two leading motives of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
exploration—the search for gold, the search for spices—were
interwoven. Pizarro had heard of a fabled spiceland hard by
the territories of the Gilded King, and this was his avowed
objective. But his imagination roved further. In the valley of
the Napo, a stream which for a space forms the boundary between
Ecuador and modern Colombia, there were plains where
the inhabitants wore armor of “massy gold.” Gonzalo would
have a look at this armor. He set forth with 500 Spaniards,
4,000 Indians, 150 horses, 1,000 dogs, and 5,000 swine and
“Peruvian sheep.”</p>

<p>While threading the passes at the very threshold of the journey
a tremendous earthquake rocked the mountains under his
feet, and an Indian village with hundreds of houses sank out of
sight. Followed the tempests, and for six weeks tropical rainstorms
with incessant thunder and lightning beat upon the men.
It was a prelude in keeping with the disasters to come. The
Land of Cinnamon was found, and left behind as too remote to
offer present profit. A brigantine was built on the Napo, and
Orellana was sent ahead with it to gather supplies in the Indian
settlements. The party never came back, but swept down the
Amazon in a wild adventure to the Atlantic sea, whence their
tales of the mighty river, its warrior women, its still stranger
peoples, and its temples roofed with gold, set Spain on fire.
Gonzalo waited for months, but he was of the strain of the
Pizarros—all hero as well as all scoundrel—and did not succumb
when he knew he had been betrayed. In a march of over
a year he led the remnant of his command back to Quito. All
his Indians had died or deserted, and only eighty Spaniards
remained. When they entered the City of the Line in June
1542, it seemed, says Prescott, as if the charnel-house had given
up its dead.</p>

<p>El Dorado of the Omaguas had many seekers, and in some
measure unveiled itself before the eyes of Philip Von Hutten.
After him, the Gilded Land had for a time a place certain on
the map. It was the region between the Guaviare and Caqueta
rivers in southeastern Colombia and northwestern Brazil—the
territory of the Omaguas, a rich and numerous Indian nation.</p>

<p>Von Hutten was a relative of the Welsers, the Augsburg
bankers to whom Charles V had ceded a large tract in Tierra-firma,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
and who had already sent out Federmann for the adventure
of Cundinamarca. The second German expedition began
almost humbly. Von Hutten had only 130 men, and when he
found that Quesada was ahead of him with 250 men, he was content
to follow in his tracks, hoping to share the rewards of discovery.
But when Quesada reached the headwaters of the
Caqueta, he had seen enough, and Von Hutten pushed ahead
into the unknown.</p>

<p>His Indian guide told him of a populous city called Macatoa
in a country rich with gold, and he even displayed small golden
apples which came from there. The winter rains overtook the
command on its road to this halfway house to El Dorado, and,
marooned on high ground, the men subsisted on maize and ants,
and on grubs, beetles, and roots. Their very hair and beards
fell off, but at length they reached Macatoa, and went on to the
land of the Omaguas.</p>

<p>From a hill they saw at last the city they sought. It stretched
beyond the utmost range of the vision—long streets and densely
clustered houses, and a temple. In the temple, the guide said,
were idols of gold as tall as small children, and one golden
statue as tall as a woman, with other treasures above price.
Beyond, he assured them, lay still richer cities. What they saw
and what they heard were enough for Von Hutten and his band.
There were only forty left of them, and within the city, they
were told, was a large force of native warriors. The adventurers
clapt spurs to their horses and dashed in—and then
dashed out again, their leader wounded and fifteen thousand
Indians in pursuit. The figures are their own, as well as the
statement that they beat off the attacking force and retired.
Afterward Von Hutten was murdered by his men.</p>

<p>To die on the march, to be stabbed by one’s companions, or
to be beheaded by one’s king, seemed the lot predestined for
captains who sought the Gilded Devil.</p>

<p>As was proved again when the Spaniards quested for Cibola,
an Indian town is a deceptive thing when seen at a distance.
What Von Hutten really saw was probably a collection of
closely grouped villages, and among them a council house or
temple, larger than the others but no more imposing than the
bark communal houses under which at that time Algonquins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
were living upon Manhattan Island. Yet the bruit of his discovery
launched expedition after expedition from New World
and Old. Martin de Proveda, starting from Peru, reached the
country of the Omaguas and went on to Bogota. Pedro de Silva
brought a party of six hundred out of Spain, and in a six
months’ journey across the llanos of Venezuela saw all but thirty
die or desert. He tried again with another party of 170 Spaniards
going up the Orinoco. Famine, disease, and Indian
arrows accounted for every member of his party save one.</p>

<p>There is evidence that unruly spirits were encouraged to seek
El Dorado in order to rid the settled places of the New World
of their turbulence. Such was the expedition which Pedro de
Ursua led out of Peru in 1559. A rabble of lawless adventurers
had been attracted thither by the civil wars which followed the
conquest. The viceroy was glad to commission this young
officer and see him depart with these “Gentlemen and old souldiers
of Peru” as Lopez Vaz called them. When they reached
the Indian villages of Omagua the expected happened. The
men murdered their leader, and the command fell to Aguirre,
who told them that whoever spoke further of El Dorado should
die. With his followers he set forth to reach the Atlantic and
return by way of Panama to Peru, where he purposed to seize
“riches, bread, wine, flesh, and faire women also.” His men
murdered him in turn, but not until he had done an amazing
thing. Starting down the Amazon, his boats won the sea by
way of the Orinoco, having used the Cassiquiare to cross from
one river system to the other.</p>

<p>The Omagua chapter ends with the great and tragic expedition
of Gonsalo Ximenes de Quesada, conqueror of New Granada,
and one of the largest figures among the conquistadors,
brother of the Quesada who had sunk his means in a like search
eighteen years before. With 350 Spanish soldiers, 1,500 Indians,
a number of negro slaves, and a train of cattle and swine,
Ximenes left Bogota in 1579. Torrential rains, inundated
lands, prairie fires, mosquitoes, Indian warfare, disease, famine—the
disastrous routine of other expeditions—were repeated on
a larger canvas. Quesada got as far as the confluence of the
Guaviare and Orinoco, and then had to return. He brought
back seventy-four Spaniards and four Indians, and he left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
behind with his dead a fortune of two million dollars scattered
along the trails of the wilderness.</p>

<p>The quest of El Dorado of Manoa lowers a curtain, rich and
somber and yet of fantastic design, upon the career of the most
remarkable Englishman of the Elizabethan age. In this last
phase of a long delusion other explorers led their thousands to
die in the jungles of the Orinoco, but their endeavor does not so
engage attention as that of Raleigh, who lost little save his own
fortune and head. There are two names, and then the Elizabethan.
Antonio de Berreo, married to Quesada’s niece, came
from New Granada down the Meta and part way down the Orinoco
for three years of dark futility. He came again and
founded towns at the confluence of the Caroni and the Orinoco,
and in the island of Trinidad at the Orinoco’s mouth. His lieutenant,
Domingo de Vera, went on to Spain and came back with
a fleet and two thousand men. These perished, all but a few,
in the two towns de Berreo had founded, or in the leagues of
turbulent river that rolled between them, or in the fever-wasted
jungles into which they set forth to find Manoa. De Berreo himself
fell a prisoner to Raleigh, who had set sail from England
about the same time that de Vera embarked from Spain.</p>

<p>This time the Gilded Phantom, in order to make sure of victims
in an age about to grow weary of long quests and wary of
far horizons, had come almost across the continent to entrap
them. Not in the eastern foothills of the Andes, but along the
lower reaches of the Orinoco where the Atlantic tides still
throbbed, the snare was spread. In the mighty empire of
Guiana, it was said there was a lake of salt water almost as
great as the Caspian Sea, and upon it the largest, the fairest,
and the richest city of the world. A fugitive Inca had come
down from the Andes, and the nobles and merchants had followed
him, and long trains of llamas had borne their possessions
through the wilderness, and an armed host went before.
They “conquered, reedified and inlarged” Manoa, says Raleigh.</p>

<p>So vast was the city that when the Spaniard, Juan Martinez,
was brought into it blindfold at noon, and his face then uncovered,
he moved through it all that afternoon and night, and
the next day from sun rising to sun setting, before he came to
the palace of the emigrant Inca. At the feasts of this emperor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
so de Berreo told his captor, when he “carouseth with his captaines,
tributaries and governours,” the company stripped and
were anointed with balsam and dusted off with finely powdered
gold, blown through hollow canes. So they sat, in radiant
drunkenness, for six or seven days together.</p>

<p>Thus the striking inaugural ceremony of a vanquished Indian
tribe on the tableland of Bogota had become in the lowlands of
Venezuela the symbol of a luxurious and sensual court, and of
an intolerable splendor. Not one man, once in a lifetime, but
a host of drunken sybarites, carousing in repeated revels, wore
the golden coat; the raft on a tarn of the western plateau had
become a palace and a city greater than any other, and seated
in the eastern wilderness on a lake that was an inland sea.
Upon the mythical estate and possessions of the Gilded King
had been piled the fugitive prestige and riches of the Incas.
The magnificent and yet sordid culmination of a century of
splendid dreams and desperate endeavor, with cupidities, basenesses
and heroisms uncounted, it needed for its final victim
one who embodied in signal fashion the strength and the weaknesses
of the age. It found him in Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>Raleigh was the most accomplished man of his time, and
every fiber of him was Elizabethan. On the scaffold he said,
“I have been a soldier, a sailor, and a courtier, all of them
courses of wickedness and vice.” Let it be added that in them
he excelled most other men. He learned soldiering under
Coligny, fighting the battles of the Huguenots. As a sailor he
took prizes of Spanish treasure ships, captured Fayal, led the
attack on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz, contributed to the strategy
that threw back the Armada; with him, as with Drake and his
companions, the ruling passion was to singe the beard of the
king of Spain. As a courtier he had his place among the vivacious
friendships of the Virgin Queen, and he was rewarded
and rebuked in turn with honors, monopolies, rustication, exile.</p>

<p>Raleigh introduced the use of tobacco in England and the
culture of the potato in Ireland. He founded two short-lived
colonies in North Carolina, which has honored his memory in
the name of the state capital. He aided the colonizing ventures
of his stepbrother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and came to North
America with him. He encouraged and aided the poet Spenser.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
He assisted Richard Hakluyt in bringing out his remarkable collection
of explorers’ manuscripts. It falls in with the picture
that Raleigh was skilled in brewing new drinks, one of which
bore his name; in the Tower of London he divided the time
between his library and a small distillery he had set up in a
hen-house.</p>

<p>Like his great contemporaries, Raleigh was both a man of
action and a man of affairs—compound of statesman, <i>condottiere</i>,
and merchant-adventurer. He was also a writer of
noble gifts. Instead of moping in his long years of confinement
in the Tower, he wrote there his <i>History of the World</i>.
And he made beautiful poems. “If all the world and love were
young” is his line. His is the epigram, “The shallow murmur,
but the deep are dumb.” In one mood he could pen the invocation
beginning, “O eloquent, just and mightie Death,” and in
another carol,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If she undervalue me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What care I how fair she be?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>His best-known line, “Fain would I climb, yet fear I to fall,”
graven by him on a windowpane for the eye of Elizabeth, was
least characteristic of Raleigh. If always he sought to climb the
heights of adventure, he had little fear to fall. This record
concerns his strangest adventure and his final fall. In most part
it is the story as recounted in his book, <i>The discoverie of the
large, rich, and beautiful Empire of Guiana, with a relation of
the great and golden citie of Manoa, which the Spaniards call
El Dorado</i>. It is a fascinating book, for seldom before or
since has pen so gifted set down a travel tale; but there is
tragedy in the very title, which is the memorial of a vain dream.
Let the historian Bancroft recite the justification, or the excuse,
for the illusion of a worldly-wise man who was also an Elizabethan:
“If Elizabeth had hoped for a hyperborean Peru in the
arctic seas of America, why might not Raleigh expect to find
the city of gold on the banks of the Orinoco?”</p>

<p>The bare narrative of Raleigh’s first quest of El Dorado of
Manoa need not long detain, for this skillful administrator, intrepid
explorer, and subtle diplomat found no golden city, lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
no men in the wilderness, and had no trouble with the Indians,
whom his engaging bearing and politic address won to his side.
He had sent a ship to reconnoiter in 1594, and after his own
expedition came and went in 1595, he sent another ship in 1596
to continue the exploration, while he himself took command of
the squadron that dashed in upon the Spanish shipping at Cadiz.
Raleigh’s Guiana flotilla of the year before consisted of five
ships, one of them from the British Admiralty. That there
might be no enemy behind him, he seized the Spanish settlement
at Trinidad, capturing de Berreo; anchoring his ships there, he
set off in barges with a hundred men up the stubborn current of
the Orinoco. Six months after he sailed from England, he was
back again with some Indian hostages, some pieces of golden
ore, and the marvelous stories with which his <i>Discovery</i> is
adorned.</p>

<p>His travel narrative lays its scenes in “the insular regions
and broken world” of Guiana, which then included a good part
of Venezuela. Through its pages flows “the great rage and
increase” of the swollen Orinoco. Through them flit “birds of
all colours, some carnation, some crimson, orange-tawny, and
purple,” so that “it was unto us a great good passing of the time
to behold them.” “I never saw a more beautifull countrey, nor
more lively prospects,” exclaims Raleigh. From afar off he
gazed on a “mountaine of Christall.” “There falleth over it,”
he says, “a mighty river which toucheth no part of the side of
the mountaine, but rusheth over the toppe of it, and falleth to
the ground with so terrible a noyse and clamour, as if a thousand
great bels were knockt one against another.” Enters the note of
gold and of politics: In Guiana, it seemed, “every stone that we
stouped to take up, promised either golde or silver by his complexion.”
For “health, good ayre, pleasure and riches,” he concludes,
“this country hath no equal, East or West.” It would be
easy for the English to defend it, for the woods are so thick
along the rivers that “a mouse cannot sit in a boat unhit from
the banke.”</p>

<p>The book holds also the statement of the large national aims
of Raleigh, into which, as he assured himself, the gold hunt
fitted. Not for him were mere “journeys of picory,” nor “to go
long voyages, to lie hard, to fare worse, to be parched and withered,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
solely to “cozen myselfe.” Here was “a better Indies
for her Majestie than the King of Spaine hath any.” With the
gold of western America Spain bade fair to dominate the world.
Only by tapping the Indian treasure-house of eastern America
could the balance of power be restored. In a notable passage
Raleigh enunciates a theory of international politics that would
sound familiar to modern ears, if for the gold lust there were
substituted the lust of markets.</p>

<p>“If we consider,” he says, “the affaires of the Spanish king,
what territories he hath purchased, what he hath added to the
acts of his predecessors, how many kingdoms he hath indangered,
how many armies, garrisons &amp; navies he hath and doth
mainteine, the great losses which he hath repaired, as in 88
above 100 saile of great ships with their artillery, &amp; that no
yeere is lesse unfortunate but that many vessels, treasures, and
people are devoured, and yet notwithstanding he beginneth
againe like a storme to threaten shipwrack to us all: we shall
find that these abilities rise not from the trades of sacks, and
Sivil oringes, nor from ought else that either Spaine, Portugal,
or any of his other provinces produce: it is his Indian gold that
indangereth and disturbeth all the nations of Europe, it purchaseth
intelligence, creepeth into counsels, and setteth bound
loyaltie at libertie, in the greatest Monarchies of Europe.”</p>

<p>This enterprise of matching gold with gold, Guiana against
Peru, Raleigh hoped would be intrusted to him, and he must
have pictured himself as viceroy, under England, of such
another India as Englishmen of later centuries were to attain.
Yet the <i>Discovery</i> is a defense, as well as a political tract and
a collection of mirabilia. Raleigh’s return, empty-handed, had
aroused the resentment of some who had put money into his
venture, and the ridicule and censure of more. It was alleged
that he had procured his golden ore in Barbary, and naught
better than marcasite from Guiana. It was even noised abroad
that he had not been with the fleet at all, but had been concealed
in Cornwall while his ships were away. The dreaming adventurer
had his enemies.</p>

<p>After his second voyage to Guiana they were able to destroy
him. Twenty-one years had elapsed since the first expedition.
Twelve of these Raleigh had spent in the Tower, imprisoned on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
one of the charges of treason which in those days meant little
save that a man was disliked by the royal favorites of the
moment. At sixty-four years of age he was paroled and went
to Guiana with a squadron of fourteen vessels and the coveted
commission of governor of the country. He spoke now of a
wonderful mine and little of a thing that was in the back of his
head, for still he dreamed of Manoa’s golden towers, which, as
many men would have it, were nowhere on earth.</p>

<p>The expedition turned out disastrously. King James had submitted
to Spain through its ambassador at London a detailed
copy of Raleigh’s plans and had received what was represented
to Raleigh to be a pledge of unmolested passage to the up-river
country claimed by him by right of discovery. He found the
Spaniards fortified against him. There were clashes in which
his own son lost his life and also the governor of a river town,
kinsman of the Spanish ambassador.</p>

<p>Raleigh returned to face his fate, and in effect it was Spain’s
own hand that wrote the decree of death, for the two royal
houses were about to be united by marriage, and the Stuart was
studiously complaisant to the Hapsburg. Sir Walter was tried
on a charge of masking, under a project to discover a mine, a
piratical raid on the Spanish settlements—a charge which the
national contacts of a hundred years invested with a grim
humor. But he was executed on a more serviceable pretext, the
long-suspended sentence for treason; nor did it avail him to
urge that the king’s commission for his voyage was in itself a
grant of pardon. The night before his death on the scaffold he
wrote these lines:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en such is Time, who takes in trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our youth and joys and all we have,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pays us but with age and dust.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Thus the great Elizabethan faced and dismissed two vanities.
Equally so he had found life itself and the mocking parable of
his New World quest—for hopes, frustration; dross for gold.</p>

<p>With Raleigh ended the larger expeditions to find El Dorado.
There is a little more to say. Some years before, two parties
had sought the Gilded City, starting from far south. One came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
from Buenos Aires in 1537, all the colonists leaving that ill-fated
city, and passing up the river in the hope either of finding
El Dorado or of reaching the Spanish settlements on Lake Titicaca.
A detachment of this party halted on the Paraguay and
founded Asuncion. Another detachment, numbering two hundred
persons, pushed on into Bolivia, where the Indians ambushed
and killed them all. A later party which was led by
De Chaves left Asuncion in 1560, wandered northwest into
Bolivia and there disbanded.</p>

<p>The imaginary lake of Manoa, sometimes called Mar Eldorado
or the Golden Sea, was delineated on maps of South
America for nearly three centuries after the time of Columbus.
Periodical overflows of the Orinoco tributaries, which cover
wide regions with standing water, serve to explain the origin
and persistence of the lake legend. For the shift of the basic
legend from Colombia to Guiana, Humboldt suggests an explanation
in a custom of native tribes in the latter country.
Instead of tattooing themselves, the Indians anointed their
bodies with turtle fat and stuck spangles of mica with a metallic
luster, white as silver and red as copper, upon their skins, so
that at a distance they seemed to wear laced clothes.</p>

<p>In 1740 Don Manuel Centurion, the Spanish governor of
Santa Thome del Agostina, made further search for the fabled
lake of Manoa and the city washed by its waters. The popular
imagination was inflamed by the reports of an Indian who came
down the river Caroni. In the southern sky he showed the
natives the dim radiance of the Clouds of Magellan. This he
said was the reflection of golden ore on an island in the lake of
legend. So may one leave the city of illusion where it belongs,
in cloudland.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c22">Chapter XXII. The Dream Quests of Spain</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> search for El Dorado was the greatest of the dream
quests of Spain. It was not the first, it was not the last. Along
with lesser ventures without number Spain sought certain grand
objects. These included the Fountain of Youth, the Earthly
Paradise, the Temple of the Sun, the Cradle of Gold, the Country
of Cinnamon, the Enchanted City of the Cæsars, the Islands
of Solomon, El Gran Moxo, El Gran Paititi, the Sepulchres of
Zenu, the Temple of Dobayba, the Seven Cities of Cibola,
Quivera the prairie capital. And Spain sought also buried cities
and phantom lakes and craters abrim with liquid gold.</p>

<p>Through most of these quests is the flow of delusive water.
It sparkles in the youth-conferring spring which De Leon failed
to find. It moves in the River Jordan, for which red man and
white hunted in Florida. It sweeps past the mythical Quivera,
bearing huge canoes with prows of gold. It shines on the far
horizon of Cibola, and on it there are barks of Cathay. It
glimmers in the tarn of Guatavitá. In the legendary sea of
Manoa it reflects the fugitive gold of El Dorado. It laves the
enchanted City of the Cæsars hard by the lake of Nahuelhuapi.
In the Laguna de los Xarayes it ripples around the island home
of El Gran Moxo. It flashes on the beaches of fabled islands
west of the southern continent.</p>

<p>There were reasons for the illusory lakes of Spanish adventure.
The City of Mexico was seated in a lake with causeways
crossing it and canals reaching the heart of the city. The
Empire of Peru held Lake Titicaca as sacred. The scarcely less
remarkable civilization of the Chibchas of Colombia rendered
homage to the lakes of the central plateau. So the Spaniards
thought that when they sought other golden cities in the wilderness
they would find them on the shores of inland seas.</p>

<p>The periodic inundations of the Orinoco, the Amazon, the
Paraguay, and the tributaries of these streams deceived and disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
men with appearances which they could not understand.
One explorer would come upon a vast sheet of still water, and
in due time it would get upon the maps. Another would lead
his column dry shod over the same place, and men were slow to
realize that each had made correct report of what he saw. For
example, the legendary lake of Xarayas, long supposed to be
the source of the Paraguay, is merely a seasonal inundation; but
during high water this transitory sea extends three hundred and
fifty miles north and south and one hundred and fifty miles east
and west.</p>

<p>The things of the spirit—religion, romance, pure fantasy—animated
Spain in some of the quests it followed beside the still
waters of the lakes of dream. Its rude chivalry could serve the
ideal with a whole heart. But for the most part cavalier and
muleteer sought gold alone. Gems, spices, pepper, dyewoods,
grain fields, raw materials, rubber, bananas, coffee—these are
objects of ancient or modern enterprise in strange lands. They
meant little to the Spaniard. Nor was his deepest interest in
metal that was still underground. He was looking for the gold
that for generation after generation Indian civilizations had
brought to the surface and stored in their capital cities. The
rewards of savage toil he would seize for himself who better
knew their value, or thought he did.</p>

<p>That is why the visionary expeditions of Spain are in the
main a search for cities, or, failing these, projects to loot temples
and rifle graves. Neither the digging nor the assembling
of the golden treasure was in the scheme. The purpose was to
take the central treasure houses. So Spain had already done in
Peru. The captive Inca Atahuallpa had himself suggested a
kindred thing. For ransom he offered to fill his prison chamber,
a room seventeen feet wide and twenty-two feet long, with gold
to the depth of nine feet, or as high as the reach of the tallest
cavalier. When the bargain was made, gold began to pour in
from all corners of the empire—statues, vases, vessels, utensils,
plaques, disks, chains, temple ornaments, nuggets, and golden
dust. Of course his captors killed the Inca, and rushed on to
seek the sources whence flowed the maddening stream; and what
they found did not satisfy. Much of the treasure of the Incas
had disappeared. Nor has it been uncovered since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>Those vain enterprises of Spain, with which a great part of
the New World’s sixteenth century was filled, were attempts of
adventurers to lay hold of the gold which had escaped the conquistadors
in Mexico and Peru, or which it was imagined had
escaped them. It was supposed that the descendants of the
Montezumas, taking rich treasures with them, had retreated
northward to Cibola or to Quivera, and there renewed their state.
It was reported, and with some basis of fact, that princes of the
Inca blood had gone north, south, or east from Cuzco and set up
new cities in the wilderness. The basis of fact was the flight
of Manco Capac, called the Last of the Incas. This prince
raised the country against its conquerors, flung an army of two
hundred thousand warriors against the Spanish garrison in
Cuzco, and before night settled on the empire of the Andes gave
proof on the battlefield that there was valor in the Quichua
blood. At the mountain fortress of Choquequirau, the Cradle
of Gold, six thousand feet above the valley of the Apurimac,
Peruvian geographers believe the Last of the Incas made his
seat.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Fountain of Youth</i></p>

<p>It is best to begin the recital of the dream quests of Spain
with the dream of all ages—the search for lost youth. It was
the first of those adventures in the New World in which the sons
of Spain were to show they were different from other men, in
that when they imagined a vain thing their imagination rushed
on to action.</p>

<p>In an unfinished poem Heine sketches the beginning of this
quest. Ponce de Leon, the veteran ex-governor of Porto Rico,
lies in his hammock and an old Indian servant sings to him of
the Bahama island of Bimini with its bird song and undying
flowers, and of its interesting tenants. These were old men
restored by a magic spring to riotous youth and beldames who
had drunk of its waters and regained girlhood’s bloom; they
were afraid to return home because of the scandal their shamefully
youthful appearance would work among their friends.
Poetic license carries this sketch only a little beyond the credulity
of the period, for Peter Martyr had written at length to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>bishop of Rome of an island with a youth-restoring spring some
three hundred leagues north of Hispaniola.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f20">
<img src="images/fig20.jpg" alt="dream">
<p class="caption"><i>The Things of the Spirit Animated Spain in Some of the Quests It Followed<br>
Beside the Still Waters of the Lakes of Dream</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Spanish cavalier set sail with three ships in 1512, in
search of Bimini. There were nearly seven hundred islands
and islets in the Bahamas and his journey was through a labyrinth.
For a part of the voyage he had the strangest, and perhaps
the most fitting, of pilots. To a clump of islands near the
Lucayos he gave the name of La Vieja or the Old Woman group
because he found them without inhabitants save one ancient
woman. Her he took aboard to help guide him through the sea
passages. He found Florida, but he did not find Bimini, which
was discovered later by his captain, Juan Perez de Ortubia, the
sagacious old woman directing him to its shore. The water
there was like any other water. Ponce de Leon, however,
escaped the disabilities of age. A poisoned Indian arrow
launched from a Florida bow did for him when he was about
sixty-one.</p>

<p>Before his death, the quest for a fountain from which one
might quaff the draught of youth had been broadened to include
a River Jordan of rejuvenating baths. This was somewhere on
the peninsula of Florida, where for half a century red men and
white searched for it, bathing in every stream, lagoon, and
swamp they found, in the hope that the magic water, in some
sudden transformation scene, might betray its whereabouts.</p>

<p>Though they did not know it, the Spaniards themselves
brought to the New World the legend of the fountain of youth
and the name of Bimini, as well as that of the River Jordan.
Wiener has traced each step. In 1493, a year before the Pope
made the line of demarcation between the Spanish and Portuguese
discoveries, he had given to Spain the newly discovered
lands on condition that the natives should be baptized in the
Catholic faith. Amerigo Vespucci falsely reported that, in compliance
therewith, a fountain of baptism had been placed on an
island in the Gulf of Mexico. Peter Martyr in his <i>Decade of
1511</i> called this the <i>fonte perenni</i>, but the cartographer misread
his Latin, and on the map attached to his work a coast line
north of Cuba is called <i>isla de beimeni parte</i>. Thus the perennial
fountain became Bimini, and the fiction of a Christian
baptismal font revived a pagan myth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Enchanted City of the Cæsars</i></p>

<p>The quest of the Enchanted City of the Cæsars was the southernmost
adventure of the dreaming mind of Spain. It was
prosecuted along the slopes of the southern Andes and the Patagonian
plains beyond—that mysterious and desolate region
which made so deep an impression upon Darwin. Over the
remote prairies, peopled only by huanacos and roving bands of
tall savages, Spanish commands hunted for a capital which the
natives called Trapalanda, and which, according to the oath of
those who said they had seen it, was as great as ancient Nineveh
and as populous as Peking.</p>

<p>Outbound to the Moluccas, the story ran, a vessel belonging
to the bishop of Palancia was shipwrecked in the Straits of
Magellan. The captain of the stranded craft, Sebastian de
Arguello, found himself on the Patagonian coast with three
thousand miles of mountain and plain between his little band
and the outpost of Spanish power at Cuzco. Followed by about
two hundred soldiers and sailors, thirty adventurers, twenty-three
married women, and three priests, he struck boldly into
the heart of the pampas, moving northward. When the company
reached a region of lakes and meadows rimmed by snowy summits
resolution was taken to found there an independent state
aloof from the perturbations of the world. Other fugitives had
reached this inviting spot before the Spaniards—a numerous
native people flying from the wreck of Peru.</p>

<p>It would seem from the rapid growth of the city which was
said to have arisen upon the shore of Lake Nahuelhuapi that red
men and white mingled their blood. The first report of the
austral capital reached Concepcion in Chile, in 1557.</p>

<p>The Spanish settlements were led to picture a great, rich city
in the south. A strong wall ran around it, and over it the roving
Indians of the prairies could see reddish roofs that gleamed as
with gold. The houses were of cut stone and those who had
been within them spoke of beds, chairs, and table service made
of precious ores. The central edifice in the capital was a noble
church roofed with silver, and from it were decreed and regulated
the pompous festivals of the ecclesiastical year.</p>

<p>Wishing to keep their isolation inviolate, its inhabitants had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
an understanding with the Indians that the secret of the city
should be told to none. But when it received the name of <i>La
Ciudad encantada de los Cæsares</i> (the enchanted City of the
Cæsars), it was a presage that from all the Spanish settlements
of the south, expeditions should go forth to seek it out, for the
very words were a challenge to the imagination.</p>

<p>It was called the city of the Cæsars because the men who
founded it had been subjects of Charles V of Spain, whom men
had styled the Cæsar in recognition of his world-wide dominion.
It was called enchanted because of the beauty of its lake setting
and the splendors within its walls. Soon its people became
known as the Cæsars, and the men who conducted expeditions to
reach them as the Cæsaristas.</p>

<p>There were other motives for the quest beside the golden
treasure to be found there and the wish to visit a clime so fair
that none died save of old age. Here were a kindred people,
cut off from their fellows, and, it might be, lapsing decade after
decade into a splendid barbarism. The purity of their Christian
faith was in danger of corruption from every sort of heathen
error. Civilization and religion were both concerned in the
rescue of this fascinating creole capital, which had done so well
by itself and yet needed to renew its contacts with the world. So
said the Spaniard wherever fortune had placed him—in the
homeland, in Mexico, in the Philippines, and most of all in the
colonies of the southern Cordilleras and the eastern plains.</p>

<p>There were a number of small expeditions to seek the legendary
city, and three of importance. Diego Flores de Leon
reached Lake Nahuelhuapi from the Pacific side, heard of savage
armies massed on his front, and went no further. Half a
century later came the Jesuit father, Nicolas Mascardi. Fearing
that the southern capital might have forgotten the mother tongue
of Spain, he collaborated with another churchman in a letter
which was translated into seven languages—Greek, Latin, Spanish,
Italian, Chilean, Puelche, and Poya. The letter was sent
ahead by an Indian courier after he reached the shores of
Nahuelhuapi. Hearing a report that the site of the city was
near the Atlantic, he crossed the continent, and then turned
southward toward the Straits of Magellan, falling at last to an
Indian arrow. This was in 1673. More than a century afterward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
the Franciscan friar, Menendez, was sent out by the viceroy
of Peru, but found no city beside Nahuelhuapi.</p>

<p>Thereafter faith in the fable died, save among the imaginative
and the credulous. Of the former was Charles III of Spain,
who died believing it in 1788. Of the latter are the common
people of Chile and Argentina, who see in the streams of lava
and volcanic sand at the foot of Osorno the roads of a hidden
people, and who still hear in the noise of the avalanches upon
Tronador the thunder of artillery along enchanted battlements.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Seven Cities of Cibola</i></p>

<p>In the quest of the Seven Cities of Cibola Spain dreamed
northward, and again deluded itself by the magic and sonority
of a name. When the fable was full blown it was of a city as
great as the capital of the Montezumas and ruled by a fugitive
prince of that house. Lesser cities surrounded it, as they surrounded
Tenochtitlan on the plateau of Anahuac. It stood
beside a great inland sea out of which flowed the Colorado, and
on the coasts of this land were ships from China.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the plains were cattle of deformed shape
and ferocious aspect, which the Spaniards called the kine of
Cibola. The inhabitants of the seven cities, says Friar Marcos,
who saw them at a distance, were a people “somewhat white,”
clad in cotton garments and dwelling in stone houses with flat
roofs. The Franciscan continues: “They have emeralds and
other jewels, although they esteem none as much as turquoises,
wherewith they adorn the walls and porches of their houses,
and their apparel and vessels, and they use them instead of
money through all the country. They use vessels of gold and
silver, for they have no other metal, whereof there is greater
avail and more abundance than in Peru.”</p>

<p>This capital of the buffalo country was located within the
limits of the present United States. Somewhat shrunken from
the dimensions of legend, it is still in existence and the descendants
of the men fabled to traffic with Cathay go about its streets.
Their skins are darker than Marcos reported them, but they have
the features and expression of white men.</p>

<p>Here is another myth of a gilded land and a refugee king, but
overlaid with material of a strange texture brought from afar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
Its scene is inland where buffalo are feeding; yet one of its
windows commands the Pacific with slanting Chinese sails upon
it, and into the other comes an old tale of the open Atlantic.
The Seven Cities of Cibola are the legendary seven cities of
Antilia, founded by seven Spanish bishops who fled the Moor,
and they are the seven caves out of which came the Aztecs. But
they are also seven towns, the remains of which, waste or tenanted,
are to be found in New Mexico near the Arizona line.
The vice of the legend is that they are small towns, and poor.</p>

<p>There are names of consequence in the quest of the Seven
Cities of Cibola, but a broad blotch of buffoonery is smeared
across it. Alone of all the visionary searches of Spain, it invites
the treatment of ironic burlesque. Yet there is heroism in
the story and a great chapter of geography.</p>

<p>The first of these names is that of the luckless but stout-hearted
Cabeza de Vaca who left a trail of wandering mishap
clear across the continent of North America, and who was yet
to break new paths through the forests and savannas of South
America where he founded the capital of the Silver Republic.
In 1536 the outposts of Melchior Diaz, who commanded in the
northern Mexican district of Culiacan, came upon a strange
party—a white man, nearly naked, with matted hair and beard,
a negro, and eleven Indians. The white man spoke in Spanish
and with such joyful agitation as to arouse a momentary suspicion.
It was Cabeza de Vaca. His negro companion was
named Estivanico. There were three other Spaniards a day’s
march behind. In what was to follow, singularly enough, the
negro is the central figure; in what had gone before the story
is the Spanish captain’s.</p>

<p>In 1527 he had sailed for Florida as treasurer of an expedition
with five vessels and six hundred men, in search of the
Golden Apalache, one of the minor dream quests of Spain.
Quitting the fleet in a Florida bay, three hundred men marched
inland to their objective. What they found was a collection of
forty wigwams on the Suwanee River and a rude people that
engaged them in daily skirmishes at arms. So they marched
on, became entangled in the swamps and bayous along the coasts
of Alabama and Louisiana, made one fatal attempt to build
rafts and cross the Gulf to the Mexican coast, and then succumbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
by degrees to the wilderness. All but four of the Spaniards
perished and these were buffeted from tribe to tribe in an
aimless drift westward. They had almost reached the Gulf of
California when they met the Spanish outpost, and in eight
years they had wandered from Atlantic to Pacific.</p>

<p>What they told launched the search for the Seven Cities of
Cibola. Farther north they had found tribes of sedentary Indians
living in stone houses, wearing cotton garments and turquoise
ornaments, and with indications of stores of gold to draw
upon. Francisco Vasquez Coronado, governor of Northwest
Mexico, was commissioned by Mendoza, Viceroy of New Spain,
to explore in that direction. Distrusting the reports of Cabeza
de Vaca, his first step was a reconnaissance under the Franciscan,
Fray Marcos. As guide and attendant the negro Estevanico
went with him, and a party of Pima Indians accompanied
them. They started northward from Culiacan in 1539, following
the coast. In Sonora the friar committed the folly of sending
the negro ahead with instructions to report to him at intervals
by messenger. If he found a mean thing he was to send a cross
a hand’s length long; if a larger matter, a cross two hands’ long;
if the negro found a country better than New Spain he was to
send back a great cross.</p>

<p>That was the last Fray Marcos saw of the negro, but he heard
from him, and from time to time he heard about him. Four
days after his departure an Indian came back bearing a wooden
cross as high as a man and the word of Estevanico that thirty
days’ march ahead were seven cities abounding in pearls and
gold, and all subject to one lord. The houses were of stone and
mortar, one, two, and three stories high, and the chief’s house
was of four stories. One of the cities was named Cibola. As
the friar proceeded, the natives brought tales which seemed to
confirm the reports, and used place names that suggested grandeur.
He heard of a province called Totoneac, of the city of
Ahacus, and of the kingdoms of Hacus and Marata.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Africa was blazing a trail far ahead into Darkest
America. It was broad, dusty with the feet of an accumulating
multitude, and finger-posted by avarice and imposture. The
negro had taken the adventure out of the hands of the too-trusting
monk. In his wanderings with Cabeza de Vaca he had won<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
assurance, some knowledge of the Indian nature, and a gourd
rattle. He moved with the state and tumult of a medicine-man,
this clapper his potent emblem of authority. The superstitious
natives met all his demands, and he demanded much—more
food than he could use, gold, green stones, women. The monk
followed, several journeys behind, in a sort of anti-climax.</p>

<p>The procession of the black Bacchus had its inevitable ending.
Marcos learned it while he was still some days from his goal.
He met a number of the Indians who had been with Estevanico,
and they were flying toward Mexico. They told of entering
Cibola with the negro, where his arrogance and folly mounted
to new levels. Noting the lowering looks of the sedentary Indians,
several of these plains Indians went outside and, hiding
themselves, awaited the finish they foresaw. One day they
beheld their companions running from the town with men in pursuit.
The negro was not with them. His hosts had killed him.</p>

<p>With two of the Indians Marcos went on to a hill from which
he looked down upon a valley dotted with villages. The nearest
of these and not the largest was Cibola. To Marcos it seemed
“as large as the City of Mexico.” It is situate, he says, “on a
plain at the foot of a round hill, and maketh shew to be a fair
city, and is better seated than any that I have seen in these parts.
The houses are builded in order, all made of stone with divers
storeys and flat roofs.” Then he adds from hearsay details of
golden vessels and turquoise-studded porches.</p>

<p>Setting up a wooden cross, Marcos hastened back, rejoicing,
to make his report to the viceroy. Out of what he told, and the
far-sounding names of provinces and kingdoms which he had
heard, the Spanish mind made a thing too rich for the haggard
realities of the American southwest. It seemed to call for a
well-appointed expedition, and Coronado urged this on the
viceroy.</p>

<p>With Marcos as his guide he was dispatched with a land force
of three hundred and twenty Spaniards, three hundred native
allies, and a thousand Indian and negro camp followers. He
left San Miguel in February, 1540, and in May a fleet under
Alarcon was sent from Acapulco to act in concert with him along
the coast of the Gulf of California. Alarcon went to the head of
the gulf with his ships, and up the Colorado, but, learning from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
natives that white men had already entered Cibola, he returned
with his fleet to Acapulco.</p>

<p>What Coronado had entered was the Indian pueblo of Zuñi
and its attendant villages in northwestern New Mexico. As soon
as his soldiers beheld these little settlements, writes Castaneda,
who went with the expedition, they “broke out in curses against
Fray Marcos.” They accused him of deceiving them, and in
fear of his life he was glad to go back with the courier who bore
to the viceroy the report of Coronado. “I can assure your
honour,” says the report, “the friar said the truth in nothing
that he reported, saving only the names of the cities and great
houses of stone; for although they be not wrought with turquoises,
nor with lime nor brick, yet are they very excellent
houses of three or four or five lofts high, wherein are good
lodgings and fair chambers. The seven cities are seven small
towns, and they stand all within four leagues together, and none
of them is called Cibola, but altogether they are called Cibola.”</p>

<p>In his scholarly account of this expedition Bandelier defends
the credulous monk, and urges that the Spaniards had tricked
out his story with their own imaginings. He argues that the
comparison with the City of Mexico was not with the old Aztec
capital, but with the new Spanish town which, as Fray Marcos
knew it in 1539, may not have had as many as a thousand inhabitants.
As to the statement that the citizens of Cibola embellished
their houses with green stones or turquoises, it has
been learned that it was an old custom in Zuñi to decorate the
roof hatches by which the people descended to their chambers
with turquoise, malachite, phosphate of copper and other stones
or ores of green and blue. This was truthful detail, although
lending itself to exaggeration. But the golden vessels, which
most concerned the Spaniard, were fable, and the Coronado
expedition had cost $250,000.</p>

<p>Despite the forthright words of Coronado, one conquistador
who would look facts in the face, his countrymen were unwilling
to surrender the vision all at once. The English merchant,
Henry Hawks, spent five years in Mexico and in 1572 made this
report: “The Spanyards have notice of seven cities which old
men of the Indians shew them should lie towards the northwest
from Mexico. They have used and use dayly much diligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
in seeking of them, but they cannot find any one of them. They
say that the witchcraft of the Indians is such, that when they
come by these townes they cast a mist upon them, so that they
cannot see them.”</p>

<p>Zuñi lies south of the great Navaho reservation, and is a
pueblo of the same type as Taos, Acoma, Laguna, and the Hopi
towns. Its identification with the Seven Cities of Cibola rests
on the reports of the explorers themselves, on an examination
of their routes, and especially on the researches of Frank H.
Cushing, commissioner of the American Bureau of Ethnology,
who became a member of this Indian tribe in 1880 and lived
with it four years while he studied its traditions. At that time
Zuñi had sixteen hundred inhabitants.</p>

<p>These people called their home Shivano (Spanish, Civano).
Cushing found that the sonorous Marata and Tontoneac were not
kingdoms or provinces, but directions, and that one of the distant
“cities” named by the natives was Acoma, which lies near
the Mesa Encantada. While the Spaniards had denied that
Marcos and Estevanico really made a journey to the north,
Cushing heard from the Zuñi story-tellers that a “black Mexican”
had come among them and had been killed for his rudeness
to their women. Soon afterwards the first “white Mexicans”
they had seen entered their land as conquerors.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Quivera</i></p>

<p>Coronado was not content to bring back his costly expedition,
empty-handed, from the fiasco of Cibola. Again he dreamed
northward, and the name of his dream is Quivera. Between this
city of illusion in the Mississippi Valley, and the city of enchantment
which the Cæsars had reared on the edge of the Patagonian
plain, it is six thousand miles in a straight line. These
two capitals of the mirage are the farthest north and farthest
south of Spanish fantasy.</p>

<p>The conqueror of Cibola drifted into the Quivera adventure
by degrees. There must be richer pueblos east of the seven
towns, he thought, and went in search of them, discovering and
occupying many. But he found New Mexico a sterile land. He
became interested in the great buffalo herds that roamed the
plains to the north and sent his lieutenant, Alvarado, on a hunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
to secure meat. Alvarado took with him as a guide an Indian
from somewhere far to the east whom he found living with the
Pecos tribe and who figures in Spanish writings as El Turco,
“the Turk,” which was what he looked like. The Spaniard did
not stay long among the buffalos, for the homesick Turk had an
exciting tale to tell. With it, Alvarado hastened back to his
chief, and soon, with El Turco as pathfinder, the columns started
toward the northeast and Quivera.</p>

<p>This was another golden city in a prosperous land. Through
the land ran a river two leagues wide in which swam fish as
large as horses. There were great canoes upon the river, with
as many as forty men to drive them, and these had golden eagles
for figureheads. The native sovereign slumbered in the afternoons
beneath a tree the branches of which were hung with
golden bells, where the wind made music. The houses of
Quivera were built of stone and were like those of the pueblos
of New Mexico, but larger and fairer. The meats and drinks
of its citizens were served in vessels of precious metals.</p>

<p>Of this land the Turk himself was a native. But there was
another Indian exile with the party. His name was Ysopete,
and he, too, spoke of Quivera. It seemed to be a different place
farther north.</p>

<p>With one guide bent on leading him northward and the other
eastward, the expedition which Coronado conducted toward
Quivera moved like a man lost in the wilderness. It traveled
to the right for thirty-seven days and partly returned on its
tracks. Soon the Spaniards became confused and ill at ease.
In the vast monotony of the staked plains they saw no marks
by which they could guide themselves forward or find the way
back. A sense of helplessness stole over them. The very bison
that grazed around them excited a sort of fear. Their horses
went wild with terror when for the first time they saw these huge,
misshapen beasts, whose glowing eyes and hollow bellowing
were calculated to inspire awe even in men.</p>

<p>The wanderers were in latitudes less kindly to illusion than
those where other men were seeking the Gilded King, and a
glimmer of the scientific and reasoning spirit which weighs motives
and scrutinizes facts was born in them. Was not this story
of Quivera the Golden just a tale told by the settled Indians in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
order to get rid of them? Had not El Turco been instigated to
lure them by confused trails into the wilderness and leave them
to perish there? Had not one of them detected him talking to
the devil in a pitcher of water?</p>

<p>While they harbored these distrustful forebodings the Spaniards
fell in with a party of plains Indians who knew Quivera.
It was forty days’ march ahead, they said, and the columns
would die for lack of food and water upon the way. Stone buildings
and plentiful provisions in precious vessels at the end of the
way? The prairie nomads knew of none of these things. They
spoke of an encampment where the houses were made of straw
and skins, and a little maize in them, naught else. The shifty
Turk changed his story. He had not told the truth, he admitted,
as to the houses of Quivera, but it had a numerous population
and a store of precious metals. In anger the Spaniards put
shackles upon him. They were ready to go back, but Coronado
was determined, without risking too many lives, at least to see
for himself what lay at the end of the trail. He took twenty-nine
horsemen, the manacled El Turco, and Ysopete, and rode
northward with the plains Indians.</p>

<p>After thirty days of hard riding through a great treeless plain
dotted with buffalo herds and watered by a number of small
streams, Coronado reached Quivera, where he stayed twenty-five
days. He describes the region about it as a rich land in
which grew plums like those of Spain, mulberries, and well-flavored
grapes. But the settlement itself was merely the summer
camp of an Indian horde that followed the buffalo and supplemented
a beef diet with corn cakes, made from maize grown
in the river bottoms.</p>

<p>The explorer tells the story with rough candor. “I had been
told,” he says, “that the houses were made of stone and were
several stories; they are only of straw, and the inhabitants are
as savage as any that I have seen. They have no clothes, nor
cotton to make them out of; they simply tan the hides of the cows
which they hunt, and which pasture around their village and
in the neighborhood of a large river. They eat their meat raw,
and are enemies to one another and war among one another.
All these men look alike.”</p>

<p>As Estevanico had met his fate at Cibola, so the Turk met his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
at Quivera. Its people did not know him, but they welcomed
Ysopete, and for his sake the Spaniards. El Turco sought to lay
the blame on the New Mexican Indians, who, he said, had engaged
him to lead the Spaniards to their fate on the prairies.
This tale failing to help his credit, he tried to raise Quivera
against his masters, who incontinently hanged him.</p>

<p>Before turning southward to rejoin his command and take
it back to Mexico, Coronado set up a wooden cross which bore
a soldierly inscription, “Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, leader
of a campaign, came to this place.”</p>

<p>Four states claim Quivera, and the blind wanderings of the
Spaniards give conjecture a broad field to work in. One thing
certain is that La Gran Quivera, the new Mexican mission,
established after the suppression of the Indian uprisings in
1580, does not stand on its site. Bandelier thinks the site was
in central Kansas about a hundred miles north of the Arkansas
River. It has severally been contended that Quivera was a camp
of the Wichita Indians; that it was in Nebraska not far from
the state capital; and that the place the Spaniards reached was
in the southwest corner of Missouri. Cyrus Thomas, who supports
the latter view, holds that El Turco came from some tribe
near the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi, that the
great stream of which he spoke was the latter river and Quivera
a town on its banks, while the place seen by Coronado was
simply the homeland of Ysopete. Whatever the region, it would
be as vain to seek the site as to look for the camping ground in
the desert where some forgotten Arab tribe pitched its tents for
a night, and struck them at sunrise.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Islands of Solomon</i></p>

<p>There came a time when the New World was too small to hold
the visions of Spain. North and south the conquistadors had
marched, seeking what they did not find. So they dreamed
westward over the sea. They had plunged their hands in gold.
They might yet bathe in it at the Baths of Sunset.</p>

<p>As always, there were stories of islands in near-by waters
where the superstition or simplicity of the natives had heaped
up treasure that more deserving men might seize. The Spaniards
went after it, at first from Mexico. Then from the harbors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
of Peru ships began to sail westward, and fantasies spread
over the deep.</p>

<p>These voyages add two titles to the dream quests of Spain—the
Enchanted Islands and the Isles of Solomon—and the names
may stand for one reality. About six hundred miles west of the
mainland of South America, and on the line of the equator, lie
the Galapagos, comprising five large and ten smaller islands.
From the Peruvians the Spaniards learned of them, but for a
while they could not find them. They were vaguely called the
Islas Encantadas because they seemed to elude the search. The
buccaneers used them later as sallyports from which to attack
the Peruvian plate fleet. Still later whalers resorted thither, but
not until 1832 did Ecuador occupy the group.</p>

<p>This archipelago of the west may have been the basis of the
legend that grew up among the seafaring folk of Peru. It was
told that the Inca Tupac Yupanqui had made a voyage and come
upon two islands which were called Nina-chumpi and Hahua-chumpi,
or Fire Island and Outer Island. He brought back gold
and silver, a throne of copper, black slaves, and the skin of an
animal like a horse. Another account said the islands were
distant a journey of two months, and one was so large it might
be a continent. There were sheep, llamas and deer upon it and
a bareheaded people who wore cotton and woolen garments.
Although their king dwelt in a palace with mud walls, a frieze
of gold ran around it.</p>

<p>A later legend, purporting to tell of a Spanish discovery, is
very definite: A long time before, a ship from Chile had been
driven out of its course to a large island, which it coasted for
fifty days. One of the seamen, Juan Montanes, went ashore and
found a race of tall, bearded Indians and women whose braided
hair reached to their ankles. They lived in communal houses
four hundred feet long by one hundred feet wide. Numerous
rafts and sumptuously decorated canoes thronged with people
plied along the coasts. Because of his beard, the natives
treated the Spaniard kindly and pressed a gold plate and emeralds
upon him.</p>

<p>The account continues with the exactness of a seaman’s chart:
“These islands must be reached from Puerto de Arica, taking
the volcano in the bay as a landmark, such being the custom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
the Indians who come and go thither. As soon as the said volcano
disappears, the desert islands are reached. Going in
among them, after two days the large island which seems to be
a continent is sighted, and what lies to the west is still to be
discovered.”</p>

<p>There are elements in this story, such as the communal
houses and the ornate canoes, borrowed from actual expeditions
to the South Seas which the earlier legend itself had
launched. What these expeditions had set out to find was a
continent about two thousand miles to the west, which stretched
northward for three thousand miles from the latitude of Tierra
del Fuego to 15 degrees south, or almost on a line with Callao;
a domain about the size of that afterward discovered and named
Australia, but lying on the near side of the Pacific. Rumors
of such a continent passed from tavern gossip to palace conferences.
Sarmiento de Gamboa had gathered and analyzed Inca
traditions of Pacific islands and the learned men of the colony
assumed that a continental mass lay behind them. So in 1567
the governor of Peru dispatched two small ships with one hundred
and fifty men and put his youthful nephew, Alvarado de
Mendana, in command.</p>

<p>An incredible thing happened. These frail vessels, provisioned
for a voyage of two thousand miles, drove westward
without sighting land for seven thousand miles. In two months
they crossed the width of the Pacific, making their land-fall in
the East Indies. For six months the crews explored the capes,
creeks, and jungles of a group of islands flanking New Guinea
on the east. Then the ships started back and were off Callao
twenty months after they had left it. They brought no gold,
but stories of “a naked, cheerful people of a bright reddish
colour”—in reality, head-hunting cannibals, to this day the most
savage of men.</p>

<p>Nearly thirty years went by before another expedition was
undertaken, and meanwhile legend was at work. It gave the
distant group the name it bears upon the map. These were
called the Isles of Solomon, says Lopez Vaz, “to the ende that
the Spaniards, supposing them to bee those Isles from whence
Solomon fetched gold to adorne the temple at Jerusalem, might
bee the more desirous to goe and inhabit the same.” But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
Portuguese writer adds that because Drake and other raiders
had entered the South Seas, it was determined not to settle them,
so that interloping vessels Molucca-bound might have no succor
on the way.</p>

<p>In 1595 Mendana, now middle aged, undertook to colonize
the islands, going out with four ships and 368 emigrants—men,
women and children, his own wife among them. Then another
amazing thing happened. The Spaniards could not find the
Solomons. They discovered the Marquesas, and in the island
of Santa Cruz founded a short-lived colony where Mendana died
and whence the expedition went forth again to disaster. Quiros,
Mendana’s great lieutenant, returning to Peru, represented to the
viceroy that the islands come upon by his chief must screen an
unknown continent, as in fact they did. In 1605 he was sent
out to find them. He discovered the Society Islands, the Duff
group and the New Hebrides, but nowhere was there trace of the
Isles of Solomon.</p>

<p>Dissolved into fable, for two centuries they were lost to
geography. In the waterside taverns of Peru, people still talked
of them. But it had become a maxim of the viceroys to treat
the discovery as a romance, and learned men concurred. The
group was erased from the maps of the world. Although it includes
ten great islands stretching for six hundred miles in an
almost unbroken barrier across the track of navigators, and
although the first Spanish expedition brought back information
so detailed that every headland and harbor which Mendana
passed has since been identified, yet for two hundred years nobody
could find the archipelago. When it was rediscovered it
was from the other direction. Carteret and Bougainville, rounding
Africa and entering the South Seas in the latter part of the
eighteenth century, came upon islands which were found to be
the lost lands of Spain.</p>


<p class="large"><i>The Sepulchers of Zenu</i></p>

<p>There are significant words in Raleigh’s <i>Discovery of Guiana</i>.
Here, he says, “commanders that shoot at honour and abundance
shall find more temples adorned with golden images, more
sepulchres filled with treasure, than either Cortez found in Mexico
or Pizarro in Peru.” Moreover, it is virgin soil: “the graves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
have not bene opened for golde, nor the Images puld downe
out of their temples.” Spain’s hunger for gold pursued the
Indians into their sanctuaries, and even into their graves.</p>

<p>The Bachelor Enciso and Balboa, each in turn commander of
Darien, sought golden treasures, which, as report ran, Indian
piety had heaped in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Enciso went forth to sack the Sepulchers of Zenu. This
province lay some twenty leagues west of Cartagena. From its
steeps the rains washed gold down in such profusion that the
natives caught in nets nuggets as big as eggs. Zenu was also
the cemetery for all the tribes of the country. For ages they
had brought their dead thither for burial, and deposited golden
ornaments with the bodies in the tombs. The soil, the Spanish
lawyer thought, must have become incredibly rich from this
long accumulation. It was no sacrilege to plunder the dead,
for were these not pagans, buried according to the rites of an
idolatrous faith?</p>

<p>Landing on the coast of Zenu, Enciso found an army under
two caciques drawn up to oppose him. The lawyer in him
prompted him to put his opponents in the wrong before appealing
to arms. So he had a formal statement read to the two
chiefs. The colloquy which followed, and which he reports
himself, is one of the most interesting incidents in all the contacts
of white men with savages. The statement recited that
there was one God who ruled in heaven, that in the Pope He
had a vicar who ruled on earth, and that the latter had awarded
Zenu to the King of Spain. The Indians replied that they accepted
the sovereignty of God in heaven, but nothing further.
The Pope, they said, must have been drunk, to give away what
did not belong to him, and the King somewhat mad, to ask of
him what was not his to give. If the King came to take it, they
would cut off his head and set it on a stake; and they pointed
to other stakes on which heads were set.</p>

<p>Whereupon there was fighting, in which, Enciso says, the
Indians had the worse of it. But two of his men, slightly
wounded by poisoned arrows, died raving; the country was hostile
beyond what he had anticipated, and his force small. He
went away without rifling the sepulchers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>


<p class="large"><i>The Temple of Dobayba</i></p>

<p>Balboa, succeeding Enciso at Darien, heard of a province
called Dobayba forty leagues away on the banks of the Atrato.
It was named either from a goddess or from an Indian princess
to whom, after death, divine honors were paid. Her worship
was conducted in a great temple, whither natives came with
their offerings. At stated times the caciques of remote provinces
sent a golden tribute, together with slaves for sacrifice.</p>

<p>Superstition and fear piled up treasure at this shrine. At one
time its worship had been neglected. Then a great drought fell
upon the land, the springs and rivers dried up, and a scourge of
death was visited upon the neglectful nations. The survivors
renewed their zeal and redoubled their offerings of slaves and
gold. Thus from generation to generation the wealth of many
peoples drained into the blood-stained temple. The prospect of
spoiling a heathen shrine profaned by human sacrifice and
piled high with idolatrous gold presented itself not as a desecration
but as a duty.</p>

<p>On his first journey Balboa mistook a deserted frontier village
for the temple town. When he went again, it was at the behest
of Pedrarias, who had been made governor of the colony, and
whose jealousy prompted him to set Balboa a task that might
bring disgrace. The quest of Dobayba was now deemed an
enterprise of romantic promise but of high hazard. The way
thither led through tribes of bold and crafty savages. In the
dreary fens lurked animals to be dreaded, including monstrous
importations from classic myth. Clouds of mosquitoes swarmed
above the stagnant water, sinister lizards crawled on the banks,
crocodiles haunted the ooze. Dragons couched there, so said
report, and huge bats flitted by on vampire errands. Peter
Martyr even mentions two harpies. A later age was to discover
the enigmatic White Indians. Rather than enter this accursed
region, the coast natives were wont to shun the direct routes and
travel the steep paths of the mountains.</p>

<p>Balboa was to win neither gold nor glory upon his forbidding
mission. Passing up the Gulf of Oraba and into the river
Atrato with a fleet of canoes, the expedition was ambushed by
Indian canoes, losing half its number. Its leader, wounded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
made shore with the remainder and at sunset began a crestfallen
retreat to Darien.</p>

<p>The temple of Dobayba—if there was a temple—was left
inviolate, to receive the gold and shed the blood of heathen until
the tropical forest swept in and buried it in a green oblivion.</p>


<p class="large"><i>Other Quests</i></p>

<p>Of certain other Spanish quests less has been recorded, because
they were incidental to larger undertakings or were conducted
by small parties of adventurers, monks, or treasure-seekers,
rather than by columns of troops sent out by provincial
governments. Pious men sought the Terrestrial Paradise toward
the headwaters of the Orinoco. From all points of the compass
explorers hunted for the Kingdom of Women. Sometimes the
conquistadors reiterated their own exploits, as when Federmann
looked for the House of the Sun in the Colombian Andes, although
under the name of the Temple of the Sun it had already
fallen to Pizarro. The adventure of the Golden Chain was attempted
on several occasions, parties of Spaniards undertaking
to drain the crater lake of Urcos, into which, tradition said, had
been flung a massive chain of gold long enough to encircle the
great square at Cuzco.</p>

<p>The quest of the Cradle of Gold is of the last century, and
here the magic of a name again wrought its spell, two hundred
years after the feet of the conquistadors had passed. Bingham,
who climbed to this ruined mountain fortress a dozen years ago,
believes that Choquequirau is just a name of Indian poetry,
misunderstood. Seen from a distance, the ridge on which it
lies resembles a hammock, and its only gold may be that which
the setting sun flings upon it. But the name itself, and the vagueness
of knowledge as to its last defenders, led to various attempts
to reach the ruin from the valley below. One party
brought back reports of rock-built “palaces, paved squares,
temples, prisons and baths.” The prefect of the Peruvian department
of Apurimac, using a company of soldiers and Indian
carriers, built a way across the rocky gorges and up the steep
mountain side to Choquequirau. This, it is thought, was the
eyrie of the last Inca—neither temple town nor treasure house,
but a frontier fortress of the long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>The legendary Laguna de los Xarayes was indicated on the
early maps of South America as lying at the sources of the
Paraguay. In it was the splendid island home of El Gran
Moxo. The imagery of the Hebrew prophets was borrowed to
describe his palace with its golden and silvern vessels, its doors
of bronze where living lions in chains of gold kept guard, its
cloud-like tower where a disk of silver, in shape like the moon,
shed light over the waters.</p>

<p>Explorers sought this island magnificence in vain. When
they came in the dry season, they could not find even the lake
in which it swam, for what seemed to be a vast lagoon was
merely high water on the Paraguay.</p>

<p>One of the golden visions of Spain recoiled upon its head.
The Spaniards would not have it that with a single blow they
had struck down the power of the Incas and laid hold of all their
riches. It seemed to them they had merely precipitated a dispersal
and an exodus—the going out of Indian princes and
property to found new seats elsewhere. One of these was the
great city of Paytiti, also called the White House, which had
risen near the confluence of the Huallaga and Marañon in the
forests of Peru. The legend which the conqueror propagated
of a fugitive dynasty grown strong in exile was cherished by
the humbled Quichuas, and twice it roused them to arms.</p>

<p>In 1740 Juan Santos assumed the name of Atahuallpa, raised
an army from the uncivilized members of various tribes, drove
out the missionaries, and for a space made the name and power
of Paytiti a fact on the borders of Peru. Again, in 1780, Tupac-Amaru,
a descendant of the Incas, appealed to the legend,
aroused the country, abolished enforced mine service and ecclesiastical
dues, and became master of most of the Peruvian
plateau. The insurrection was put down and its leader executed,
but the injustices he had fought were never restored in
full vigor, and passed altogether when Peru rose against Spain
in the War of Independence. The dream of Paytiti had become
a vision of liberation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c23">Chapter XXIII. The Fabric of Illusion</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> traditional world, like the modern world, is a fabric
woven of many stuffs and colors, and patched with strange materials,
some old, some almost new. If one wonders how it was
all thrown together, one must consider that the type of mind
which collects and analyzes facts, which experiments in order
to discard error, which defines terms and reasons from them,
did not appear until late in the world’s history and even now
is not common. Aristotle, the chief scientist of antiquity, debated
why a dead kingfisher, suspended from a string, should
foretell the direction of the winds by turning its bill toward
that corner of the heavens whence they were to come. Sir
Thomas Browne hung a kingfisher on a string, and found that
it did not do this thing.</p>

<p>Except when directed to its immediate problems of food and
shelter, the antique mind thought in images, rather than in definite
terms. Its processes were akin to dreams, in which one
takes strange things for granted, nor seeks to verify anything.
Save when they drove a bargain, men took one another’s statements
for granted. Much the same thing is true of the savage
to-day.</p>

<p>The realms and races of prodigy form the main burden of
travel tale. Except when travels took the form of commercial
voyagings, or military expeditions, and with a few other exceptions,
such as the journeys of Pytheas the Massilian and Marco
the Venetian, their theme, almost until modern times, was wonder.
Home-keeping folks wanted to hear, as still they do, of
countries and customs, and men and animals, that were different.
The myths of geography have come out of the contacts of
the dreaming mind of savagery and early civilization with the
unknown. They represent men in the process of getting acquainted
with the world about them.</p>

<p>For primitive man they began at the very boundary of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
district. Mystery was there, and forbidding things were suspected;
and if waste lands lay beyond, these got themselves
uncouth populations. The stranger that crossed the boundary
was dreaded and hated as something not quite human, or at
least as wielder of a magic that might work harm. It is said
of wild tribesmen in Borneo that when they meet a stranger they
turn their backs and hide their faces because the sight of him
makes them dizzy. “The stranger is for the wolf,” is an Arab
saying, and the early rule of the world was that he must die
in the interest of those upon whom he had thrust himself. “He
had salt water in his eyes,” was the Fiji formula when castaways
were clubbed to death. Many tribes call themselves by
names which mean simply “men,” as distinguished from all
other peoples, whose human nature is not conceded.</p>

<p>But the cruel host of to-day might be the helpless guest of
to-morrow. There came a time of toleration, the limited toleration
recorded in the Slavic proverb, “A guest and a fish smell
on the third day.” As men crossed and recrossed the tribal
boundary its weird legends were shifted to remoter horizons,
became things to gossip about rather than act upon, and might
mellow into genial report. Even historical peoples living at
a distance were swathed in horizon haze. The justice of the Indians,
their freedom from bodily ailments, and their contempt
of death are favorite themes of Ctesias. Herodotus spoke of
the Egyptians as later ages have spoken of the Chinese. Adam
of Bremen gave a fantastic picture of the peoples of the far
north—small, sinister Finns, whose magic could wreck passing
ships and draw the very fish out of the sea; cruel islanders colored
bluish green by salt water, and the “most noble” Northmen,
bravest, most loyal, most temperate of men. Above all
other races in consideration, so the west agreed for some centuries
of unwonted humility, were the Chinese. Among them,
says Purchas, “is reported to be neither Thiefe nor Whore, nor
Murtherer, nor Hailes, nor Pestilence, nor such like Plagues.”
And they live to be two hundred years old.</p>

<p>Travelers were the agents of distance, bringing the woof
which the stay-at-home worked into the warp of his fancy. Until
very recent times they were the world’s telegraph, mails and
newspapers, all in one. Their coming was an event, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
going was remarked upon. Over rough ways, through countries
where inns were not, among peoples who had instinctive dislike
of a stranger and deemed it no fault to despoil or enslave him,
the wanderer pursued his uncertain fates as merchant, pilgrim
or mendicant. He paid his fare by the stories he took with
him—winning a precarious hospitality in strange lands and an
eager welcome when he reached home. The more curious the
tale he told, the more kindly he was entreated—Ulysses repaid
royal hospitality with royal guerdon—and in the ancient world
so little was known that one might tell almost any tale he
pleased. There was no means of checking up a report. Of
course there were skeptics here and there, and there was, and is,
a suspicion that old men and wanderers use rather more than
the truth. The Ancient Mariner, being both old and traveled,
had a great tale to tell.</p>

<p>Whole races wandered as well as single individuals. The
migrations of peoples, and most if not all of them have had a
nomad period, have had something to do with bringing the
more beautiful of their legends into being—the tales of ideal
lands, abodes of the blest where their dead are, or whither their
heroes are translated without dying. The journeys of the sun
are tracked upon them and human wistfulness has builded there,
but so has memory. The homeland which the ancestors of a
people abandoned long before, driven out, it may be, by an
invading host, lives in its legends as a region desirable above all
others. The hardships of the exodus are remembered also, and
tradition magnifies the cruel height of the mountains, the swiftness
of deep, unfordable rivers, the terror of moonless trails
and all the heavinesses of the way. When the dead go home,
or the heroes pass to rest, the path of souls which they travel
back is the path their forefathers followed and the one journey
ends where the other began, in a land that is a province of the
Golden Age.</p>

<p>This hypothesis, which is Herbert Spencer’s, may not explain
all the elysiums that a yearning fancy has created. Yet in the
South Seas they lie in the direction whence the islanders came;
the Hindu legend of the blissful Uttarakarus of the north is
thought to hold the memory of a migration southward from
some Himalayan valley; while the curious Persian legend of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
the enclosed garden of Yima, where was neither deformity nor
iniquity, may be a note on the early movement of the Iranians
from their cold ancestral home to the Azerbaijan region, and
a halt there before renewing their march toward the sun and the
sea.</p>

<p>Though seldom we may follow the process, religion, and symbolism,
which is its handmaiden, and magic, which is its elder
brother, traced the outlines of most of the fabulous animals and
peculiar peoples; human forgetfulness, savage logic and hearsay
have filled them in. The natural history of the traditional
world was in good part the contribution of the religions of
Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and India. The tribes of grotesque
peoples, the dog-faced generations, the satyrs, the demons of
the waste, the fowls with woman faces, the women with fish-tails,
the winged quadrupeds, all seem more like the carven
creatures which populate the walls and towers of mediæval
cathedrals than breathing tenants of fields and waters. The
seeming is significant. When the hunchback, Quasimodo, was
on the roof of Notre Dame at night, “then said the women of the
neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic,
supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened here and
there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of
stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched necks
and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking.”
When the edifice took fire, continues Hugo, “there were griffins
which had the air of laughing, gargoyles which one fancied one
heard yelping, salamanders which puffed at the fire, tarasques
which sneezed in the smoke.”</p>

<p>In the temples of the Middle Ages the fabulous birds of the
traditional world came home to their roosts, and the fabulous
animals to their dens. They had been taken from the temples
of earlier religions and they found their way back through the
medium of an art which did not know where these creatures
came from. Nor did ancient travelers and geographers. These,
they supposed, were real races of men, real beasts and birds.
They had never seen them, for they roamed the outer spaces,
but everywhere they saw their effigies—in the porches of palaces,
upon the columns of imperial courts, and on the monuments of
princes, as well as within the shrines of strange gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>Creatures of allegory these were, religious symbols, survivals
of totemistic worship of beasts. Yet the entablatures on which
their outlines were graven were mistaken for illustrated natural
history, accepted as literal records of fact, like the columns
which companioned them and which kings set up along the highways
of the east to proclaim that hither they had come and
here they had prevailed in battle.</p>

<p>The imagery of all religions musters them. Eskimo mythology
is a witch-haunted shore, Aztec mythology a charnel-house,
Chilean mythology a forbidding menagerie. The Chiriqui
of Panama have an alligator, a jaguar, and a parrot god,
all with human bodies. In Egyptian myth one reads of the
watch-dog of Osiris in the underworld—the Swallower of the
West, mixture of crocodile, lion, and hippopotamus. On a
man’s shoulders Anubis carried a jackal head; and half human
were the bull-gods, hawk-gods, goat-gods, vulture-gods, cat-gods.
The Ægean pantheon shows human figures with the
heads of asses, lions, bulls, and birds. The god Brhaspati of
Hindu myth was seven-mouthed and seven-rayed, beautiful-tongued,
sharp-horned, blue-backed, and hundred-winged.
Hanuman was a monkey-god. The goddess Kali was a dark-blue
female with four arms and three eyes. Siva himself had
four faces, which appeared in turn when a ravishing nymph
created by Brahma walked quite around him to tempt him.</p>

<p>The evolution of these divine beast-men, ancestors of the
fabulous races of geography, begins with the annual sacrifice
of a sacred animal and the preservation of its skin for the ensuing
year. At first this was stored, then stuffed, then drawn
over a wooden or stone image, to which, as worship lost its
primal grossness, the human form was imparted. The result
might be an ass- or goat-god, a centaur or satyr. Yet, with religious
symbolism shaping it, evolution has operated also in
reverse, dowering anthropomorphic deities with animal parts
to signify typical qualities. This is seen even in Christian
story. On the choir stalls of a Rhine church begging friars
were depicted with the cowled head of a monk, but with a pig’s
body and fox tail, while a Bible of the tenth century shows the
evangelists as beast-headed men, and the four gospels as a four-headed
composite animal called the tetramorph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>Out of the magic dances of men, as out of their temples, the
races of fable have come trooping. By donning the heads and
perhaps the tails of horses, bulls, asses, and goats, and treading
certain measures, ritual mummers became, in the thought of the
time, horse-demons, ox-demons, ass-demons, and goat-demons,
and as such semidivine. They danced to bring fertility to the
flocks and herds, while the god—it is Pindar speaking—“laughed
aloud to see the romping license of the monstrous
beasts.” The masks of wild animals and of reptiles and birds
were worn also, and the motions of these creatures were repeated
in other dances, as they are to-day, in order to propitiate dangerous
beasts, or bring luck in the chase, or constrain heat and
cold, sun and rain, through animals that were their symbols.
Possibly the First People of Indian myth, equally with the
satyrs of the classics, derive from rites in which dancers simulated
beasts, and seemed, therefore, both human and bestial.
Belief that ritual dancers donned the animal nature with their
masks; travelers’ reports; the ambiguous records of pictograph
and frieze, and tribal forgetfulness of the meaning of long-abandoned
rites—all were avenues by which the mummers
passed out of the atmosphere of a naïve township magic into
the spacious precincts of marvel. Greek tragedy and Greek
comedy grew up in their steps, flourished for some splendid
moments, and died out. But the ritual mime, whence these
came, is still danced by peasants clad in skins.</p>

<p>If, as pragmatism claims, the intellectual world is “pervaded
and perverted by errors, lies, fictions, and illusions”—things
real only in the sense that they can be talked about—it could
not be otherwise than that the folk-mind would throng the galleries
of fable with its cruder creations. Was it not a slighter
thing to picture “gorgons, hydras, and chimæras dire” than to
give the wood its guardian deity, or to reach the poetry of Indian
belief that the echo is the Lizard-Man telling back? The
night terrors of the savage, the dream figures of an age when
dreams were very real, the hallucinations of medicine-men,
the deep reactions of the imagination to what seems abnormal
but is merely strange, even the easy success of the alarming
masks and deforming paraphernalia of tribesmen on the warpath—all
contributed to the fabulous populations. In the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
of the mind, one chamber is a museum where it strives to improve
on nature’s handiwork. It invents no new thing, but it
shifts familiar combinations, exaggerating, deforming, recombining.
The product is either a caricature or a composite, a
grotesque or a chimæra. Nature itself has set a pattern in the
bat, which the Persians say is compounded of bird, dog, and
muskrat, since it flies like a bird, has dog teeth and lives in
holes like a muskrat.</p>

<p>By his own handiwork has man been misled, or led away
into curious valleys of vision. Savage art seems constrained by
some obscure law of the mind to give its subjects, be they god,
man, or beast, a grotesque delineation. It may be that primitive
drawing was evolved inversely from the drawing of children,
whose first animals are usually horizontal human beings;
the first men pictured by the cave artists were more like erect
animals. Paleolithic man, so Luquet thinks, learned how to
represent animals before he did men, and gave the latter beast
countenances and misshapen members in his early attempts to
represent them. The stuff of myth is in the rock drawings. In
sculpture itself its influence is clearly marked.</p>

<p>On the evidence of broken statues, desert peoples based tales
of forgotten races that had been turned into stone. On the evidence
of wooden idols, snow-mantled in the land of the Samoyeds,
their neighbors based tales of a northern nation frozen
into immobility with each recurring winter and thawed out by
the sun’s return. There were sculptures and bas-reliefs in
Egypt which ministered to the pride of kings by picturing them
several times as large as their subjects and vassals; and these
were evidence to the stranger that he had come into a country
which held both giants and dwarfs. Primitive drawings betray
ignorance of perspective, and this archaic style was retained
by religious conservatism after art had found itself. The sculptures
that show Egyptian countenances in profile, with eyes as
long as in the full face, also show profiles of quadrupeds having
but two legs and a single horn. Here, and not in “the wild,
white, fierce, chaste moon, whose two horns are indissolubly
twisted into one,” may be the secret of the unicorn.</p>

<p>The power to evoke myths of the living has been in marble
statues and wooden images from the beginning, for in the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
they were wrought in the thought that life would
enter them. A passage in <i>The Flame of Life</i> reveals the creative
quality in D’Annunzio reacting to their spell: “In the fruit
orchards, in the vineyards, among the vegetables, among the
pastures, rose the surviving statues. They were numberless
like a dispersed people. Some still white, some gray or yellow
with lichens or greenish with moss, or spotted; in all attitudes,
with all gestures, goddesses, heroes, nymphs, seasons, hours,
with their bows, with their arrows, their garlands, their cornucopias,
their torches, with all the emblems of their riches,
power, and pleasure, exiled from fountains, grottos, labyrinths,
harbors, porticos; friends of the evergreen, box, and myrtle,
protectors of passing loves, witnesses of eternal vows, figures of
a dream far older than the hands that had formed them and the
eyes that had seen them in the ravaged gardens.”</p>

<p>Sovereign reason itself has sent emissaries to the courts of
fable. Science is tolerant and until it knows it speaks the language
of Montaigne, “It is a sottish presumption to disdaine and
condemne that for false, which unto us seemeth to beare no
show of likelihood or truth.” Empedocles, precursor of physical
scientists, and perhaps first to glimpse the doctrine of evolution,
provided the classic world with a working explanation
of the prodigious animals and peoples and gave a law to the
menageries of myth. He thought that the various parts of men
and animals were separately created by the elements, which were
his deities. There were heads without necks, arms without
shoulders, eyes without sockets; and as they wandered about in
space these members united, forming man-headed beasts, beast-headed
men, and various bizarre beings which because of their
maladjustment did not survive in competition with normal men
and animals. The doctrine has been echoed in modern times
in the contention that the composite creatures of fable—part
reptile, part bird, and part beast—represent intermediate forms,
experiments which nature inaugurated and abandoned in evolving
higher types of life. The marsupial kangaroo, the duck-billed
platypus, and the flying lizard are surviving testimony to
such experiment.</p>

<p>A kindred philosophy may be discerned here and there in the
folklore of aboriginal Americans. In the deluge legend of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
Pimas, Fox and Sister, escaping in two arks, set to work to
fashion a new world of men out of mud; Fox molds manikins
with one arm, one leg, one eye, but Sister derides these and tells
him to put his journeyman’s product away behind the ocean in
another world; then she breathes into her own better handiwork
the breath of life; these deformed folk are still living somewhere,
the Pimas think. The haunting Indian myth of a First
People, who had the human form but the beast nature, and from
whom the animals derive, and the companion myth of a First
People who had the brute form, but discarded it for the human,
are things with the Empedoclean quality, but reach deeper;
and a true note of observation is in them. Somewhere in every
man one catches a glimpse of some animal. All created things
are reflected in his form, his gait, his face. “Somewhat of
me down there?” was the question of Emerson when he caught
a dog’s understanding glance; and in men’s countenances he
had seen, he thought, “the features of the mink, of the bull,
of the rat, and the barnyard fowl.”</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid take on a tinge of plausibility.
“What keeps these wild tales in circulation for thousands
of years?” asks Emerson. “What but the wild fact to
which they suggest some approximation of theory!” In lighter
vein in <i>Penguin Island</i> Anatole France sketches the metamorphosis
of birds into men: “Immediately the penguins were
transformed. Their foreheads enlarged and their heads grew
round like the dome of St. Maria Rotunda in Rome. Their
oval eyes opened more widely on the universe; a fleshy nose
clothed the two clefts of their nostrils; their beaks were changed
into mouths, and from their mouths went forth speech; their
necks grew short and thick; their wings became arms and their
claws legs; a restless soul dwelt within the breast of each of
them. However, there remained with them some traces of
their first nature. They were inclined to look sideways; they
balanced themselves on their short thighs; their bodies were
covered with fine down.”</p>

<p>There is good terrestrial history as well as the dreams and
guesses of the mind hidden in travel tales, and in them are embalmed
some of the oldest memories of mankind. Paleolithic
man found various subraces of men in Europe when he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
there, savage prowlers from whose skeletal remains modern
science has restored the outlines of squat, ape-necked, beetle-browed
human beings, crudely formed as a heathen idol.
Against these he waged the relentless war of one species against
another—a war of extermination. The memory of their odious
appearance would survive longest in the stories told to entertain
or frighten children. As Sir Harry Johnston has suggested, “the
dim racial remembrance of such gorilla-like monsters, with
cunning brains, shambling gait, hairy bodies, strong teeth, and
possibly cannibalistic tendencies, may be the germ of the ogre
in folklore.”</p>

<p>It is certain that folklore shows the traces of other and less
frightful races of men who in turn were driven off the European
scene. The giants of nursery tales are identified by Tylor with
Stone Age heathen, shy of the conquering tribes of men, loathing
their agriculture and the sound of their church bells. When
the Scandinavian sagas speak of dwarfs, furtive and cunning,
garbed in reindeer kirtle and colored cap, hiding in caves, and
armed with bone-tipped arrows, they are picturing the persecuted
and once widely spread Lapp race.</p>

<p>It may be that a vague recollection of now extinct animals has
survived in legend. There is an Iroquois story recorded by
Father Charlevoix of a great elk which stood so high that eight
feet of snow did not impede his movements, and with “a sort
of arm which comes out of his shoulder and which he uses as we
do ours.” Kaska tribesmen speak of a large, hairy, tusked
animal which roamed their land long ago. The Indians of
North America must at some time have seen living members
of the elephant family. It has been suggested that the tortoises
of Hindu myth which bear the world on their backs are a
memory of the huge Himalayan tortoise.</p>

<p>There are legends that are true myths of observation, exercises
not of memory, but of primitive logic. They disclose man
pondering the ruinous records of the past and satisfying the
necessity for a theory that shall explain them. The diminutive
burial cysts and dolmens made by departed races and scattered
over the world were thought to be the graves of dwarfs, or their
houses, or their treasure places. Fossil bones have produced
a veritable cycle of these philosophic myths. The frozen mammoths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
and fossil bones of Siberia have been known to man from
earliest times and have produced a stock of legends as well as
an immemorial trade in ivory. Some of these, reciting the
battles of prehistoric animals with one another and with men,
have almost the dignity of epics.</p>

<p>The mistaken logic that produced the creatures of legend
has had at various points a sort of whimsical confirmation.
Save for his fiery breath, the dragon of fable mirrors the leathern-winged,
serpent-tailed, crocodile-bellied saurians that
haunted the marshes of the ancient world and passed from the
scene ages before man is supposed to have come upon it. There
are living things as weird of aspect as any created by the unbridled
imagination of man, but most of them are small. Such
are the vampire bat, the dragon fly, and the so-called fiend fly,
the black face and curved horns of which gave it in the Middle
Ages a diabolic name. Seas and fresh-water streams and
marshes all contain creatures which so much resemble, and so
much differ from, the familiar land animals as to seem the
product of a conscious venture into the grotesque. With a fish
net and microscope one might bring to view an array of animals
that in everything save size would rival the exhibits of
fable. The wildest dream of man has not pictured anything so
beautiful and strange as the life-drama of the little creature that
is first a larva, then a chrysalis, and then the butterfly of a
single summer.</p>

<p>There are words in which the germinal idea has been so enveloped
in wrappers of metaphor and inference, so incased in
concentric shells of rationalization, so burdened with borrowed
significances, so freighted by sentiment and reflection, and so
enriched by art and historical accretion that they may be called
microcosms of the world of fable; the proper noun, Babylon, is
one of these. In large measure the peoples of prodigy and in
some measure the lands of legend owe their being to a search
for causes confined within the domain of etymology. They may
be called a literary phenomenon, a product of words and the
ways of words, and a by-product of libraries. Words breed
myths. Given a Rome, people will invent a Romulus. Given
the ancient Britons and Celts, people will invent a Britannus
and a Celtus, their eponymous chiefs. The theory of totemism—supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
descent from an animal ancestor—arose, as Spencer
thinks, from the efforts of savages to explain the animal names
which they bore.</p>

<p>When the meaning of words becomes forgotten or their form
corrupted, a myth follows. Mediæval Spain, for example, believed
that Jews were born with tails, confusing the word rabbi
with rubo (a tail). Château Vert in England has become Shotover,
and peasants have it that Little John shot over a high hill
near by. Maid Marian of the Robin Hood ballad cycle is the
Mad Morion of the Morris dance, a boy who whirled through
its measures wearing a morion or helmet.</p>

<p>How names can become corrupted the public-house signs of
England will attest. The Bag O’Nails should be the Bacchanals;
the Bully Ruffian should be the ship Bellerophon; the Cat and
Wheel should be St. Catherine’s wheel; the Goat and Compasses
should be God Encompasses Us; the Iron Devil should be Hirondelle
(the swallow), and the Queer Door should be the Cœur
Doré (the golden heart). The effigies of bags of nails, cats,
goats, and doors under these uncouth names are pictorial fables
based upon bad etymology.</p>

<p>In like fashion Pliny confused the name of the Canaries with
the Latin <i>canis</i> (dog) and says these islanders are called thus
because, like dogs, they devour the entrails of wild beasts. Similar
confusions of words have brought legendary islands upon
the maps. Avalon, the Celtic paradise in the west, whither
Arthur was ferried unto peace, is Apple Island of the classics,
the place of the golden, dragon-guarded apples of the Hesperides.
Antilia, mystic mediæval island of the remote Atlantic,
is perhaps Ante-ilya, or island off the Portuguese coast.
Milton’s “cold Estotiland” and Estland, islands which held their
place for centuries on the maps of the northern seas, are probably
misreadings for Scotland and Iceland, transferred from
faded sketch-maps to a Venetian chart of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>“Not Angles, but angels,” said a punning ecclesiastic when
he saw fair-haired Saxon captives in the slave markets of the
Mediterranean. So the Greeks and Romans gave to savage
tribes the names that in their own tongues sounded most like
what these tribes called themselves. A myth might result—a
record of some deformity, or some inhuman custom. A larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
number of myths arose from men’s giving a literal meaning to
figurative terms in their own language. To speak in riddles
was more than a social game with the ancients, is more than a
social game now with various peoples. There were certain
things which must not be named, but only referred to indirectly.
There were times when riddles must be propounded and
times when they must not; and riddle-time, says Frazer, was
usually in the presence of a dead body or at a sacrifice.</p>

<p>What might follow, a glance at a few Finnish riddles will
show. One of them runs, “Beyond the great water a large old
man shouts,” and another, “A cry from the forest and light
from the hill.” In each case thunder is the answer. The sky
is described as a blue field strewn with silver. “A child looks
through the hedge” means the sunrise. “A red cock springs
from house to house” means fire. “A small white man was
sowing, he became very mischievous,” means snow. As Müller
remarks, here are elements which in the mind of a poet or a
grandmother would soon create a number of delightful myths.</p>

<p>In its contacts with enigmatic language the end of literalism
is fable. Speak of fleet horses as children of the wind, and you
have the story of Iberian mares impregnated by the west wind.
Speak of swift runners as shadow-footed, and there appears on
the canvas of Ind the silhouettes of natives asleep under the
shade of their gigantic feet. “We are a people without a head,”
said the kingless Turkomans, and the Headless People shouldered
their way into the map of fable. “Their shoulders are
where our heads are,” Indians of Guiana told Raleigh, describing
a tall neighbor race, and artists delineated them with eyes,
noses, and mouths where their breasts ought to be. Sometimes
savage tribes stretch their ears by attaching weights to them;
hence, perhaps, the tale of folk who used one ear as mattress,
the other as coverlet. As to the people whose feet were turned
backward, may these not be, Tylor asks, the Antipodes on the
other side of the globe, whose feet, surely enough, are planted
“the opposite way” every time they set them down?</p>

<p>The method explains much, although care must be taken that
it be not made to explain too much. The germ of fable is found
in such figurative epithets as bull-browed, long-headed, horse-faced,
ox-eyed, lion-hearted, bird-witted. But for these phrases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
to fructify in marvel, it would need that in a time more naïve
and among a people who knew neither the ends of the world
nor the ways of speech, men of one race should use them in
telling another the manners and customs of a third. For cultivated
minds these conditions cannot be reproduced except in
the magic and make-believe of poetry. For the unlettered, alike
in lands of culture and of barbarism, they still exist.</p>

<p>The power of wish and the power of words are chief gods in
the world of fable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c24">Chapter XXIV. The Travel Tales of Mankind</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">When</span> the travel stories of mankind were first set down in
writing the list was already nearly complete. Little was added
afterward until the modern age began the systematic collection
of a mass of folklore which, with all its significance, had scant
literary backgrounds and less than the old geographical quality.
This is a strange thing. From generation to generation men
increased their stores of knowledge, but from century to century
they neither greatly increased nor greatly reduced their
stock of fables. There were periods when men forgot the wisdom
of the ancient world, but they remembered and repeated
its pleasant marvels.</p>

<p>These have had a long journey down the ages. The Greek
had them from the Persian, Indian, and Egyptian; the Roman
had them from the Greek; the Arab merchant and Christian
pilgrim had them from the Roman; the Celtic monk and the
viking had them alike from Roman, Arab, and Christian; and
the Spanish explorer had them from every mediæval source.
In the Spanish Americas of the sixteenth century the Age of
Fable blazed forth again and then grew dark.</p>

<p>The things added in this journey to the original stock of
travel tales were mainly local legends and variations on older
themes. The grasshoppers in one province chirped or were
silent in obedience to provincial ordinance, the fountains of
another had curative properties, there was an enchanted forest
in a third. Celtic glamour passed a wand over familiar material
and it yielded the veiled or sunken islands of the western
ocean. The quest of El Dorado came out of a Spanish
dream. Nearly all other travel tales are found in the earliest
literature. It must be that men told them to one another ages
before writing was known.</p>

<p>Various of the older books record them. They are interwoven
with myths of the supernatural in epic poetry. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
included in accounts of countries and peoples in histories, encyclopædias,
and guide-books. They decorate the narratives of
ancient and mediæval travelers. They are compiled in volumes
of mirabilia. Instances of these several records are the Odyssey
of Homer, the <i>History</i> of Herodotus, the <i>Travels</i> of Marco Polo,
and the <i>Collecteanea</i> of Solinus.</p>

<p>The special type of letters which travel tales have developed is
the collections of mirabilia. Most, perhaps all, of these have
been library pilferings and borrowings. Photios culled from
the <i>Indika</i> of Ctesias everything that was difficult to believe, and
the rest of this survey of ancient India is lost. Solinus won the
name of Pliny’s Ape by extracting the curious things from the
writings of the Roman encyclopædist and combining them in a
work which was standard for a thousand years.</p>

<p>The very skepticism of other writers evidences the industry
of the historians of marvel. In his <i>Attic Nights</i>, Gellius, a
Roman of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, tells of a bundle of musty
books which he bought for a few coppers in Brundusium. “They
were all in Greek,” he says, “and full of wonders and fables,
containing relations of things unheard of and incredible, but
written by authors of no small authority—Aristeas of Proconnesos
and Isogonos of Nicæa, and Ctesias and Onesikritos and
Polystephanos and Hegesias.” Swiftly he lists their races of
dog-headed, one-legged, headless, and feathered mortals. “As
we perused them,” says the practical but too-scornful Roman,
“we felt how wearisome a task it is to read worthless books
which conduce neither to adorn nor to improve life.”</p>

<p>When Huc was ascending a Chinese river in the middle of
the last century his native servant used to go ashore at every
stopping place and bring aboard a stock of pamphlets to read.
These products of the ready pens of the literary class included
fantastic stories of various kinds, some of them very coarsely
written. Says Huc: “The Greeks fixed the abode of their monsters
and ephemeral creatures in the east, and the Chinese have
returned the compliment by placing theirs in the west, beyond
the great seas. There dwell their dog-men, their ears long
enough to trail on the ground as they walk; there is the Kingdom
of Women, and of the people with a hole right through them
at the breast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>Best of all skeptical discussions of prodigy is the <i>Enquiries
into Vulgar and Common Errors</i> (1646), which bears the high
name of Sir Thomas Browne. Its author challenges the entire
array of travel tales, closes his eyes to the truth hidden in many
of them, recites the means by which impostors fabricate imaginary
animals, denounces “saltimbancoes, quacksalvers, charlatans,
astrologers, fortune tellers, jugglers, geomancers and the
like incantatory impostors,” and sounds a warning against
Herodotus, Ctesias, Maundeville, Pliny, Ælian, Solinus,
Athenæus, Philes, Tzetzes, and “even holy writers such as Basil
and Ambrose and Isidore, Bishop of Seville, and Albertus,
Bishop of Ratisbone.” Preachers and moralists, he says, have
made occasion for error by using for illustration the fables of
the phœnix, salamander, pelican and basilisk. The root of the
matter, he concludes, is the “deceptible condition” of men, of
which Satan took advantage in the beginning.</p>

<p>In whatever books one finds these pictures of strange lands
and races they have the effect of cameos, in that they are miniatures,
and the outlines are not subject to change. The description
is always brief, and next to nothing is added to it from
age to age. The griffin has no new habits, the dog-faced men
lived under the old law, the pygmies of the Middle Ages have
not yet won the battles with the cranes which they were waging
in the time of Homer. If a traveler sees these strange creatures
he has nothing fresh to say of them. The main thing that happens
is that they shift their places on the map, retiring always
before the advance of knowledge. Æthicus of Istria contributes
almost the only really novel touch in a thousand years. He saw,
so he says, the Amazons in the region north of the Caspian suckling
the centaurs and minotaurs.</p>

<p>That these fables came down through the centuries unchanged
is a tribute to the hold of tradition, to men’s reverence for the
written word. It is also a revelation of the way natural histories
and encyclopædias were compiled until about the time
of Buffon and Cuvier. When a thing got itself said, it had a
good chance of surviving, provided it was interesting. Other
men copied it out of a book without demanding proofs, authority
taking the place of research. The ancient geographers cited
the very poets as authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>Because they passed through endless compilations the fables
remained brief, or became so. Despite its vigor and penetrating
quality, even the <i>Geography</i> of Strabo rests for its main facts
on a multitude of travel books whose statements it abridged.
What the Greek writers could not wholly avoid was too much
for the Roman encyclopædists. They were note-takers, compilers,
abridgers, and they tried to make all learning their
province. The encyclopædias of Varro, Verrius, Flaccus, Pliny,
Suetonius, Pompeius Festus, and Nonius Marcellus were the
product not of a staff of experts, but in each case of a single
mind. The editors epitomized everything. They made extracts
from books, extracts from extracts, abridgments of abridgments.
The original works they consulted were lost, and only fragments
of the mental inheritance of the Roman world were transmitted
from age to age. Under the modern system of specialized inquiry
the frontiers of knowledge press ever outward. Under
the old encyclopædists they drew inward and the body of known
facts shrank continually. This tendency culminated in Isidore,
Bishop of Seville in the seventh century, last of the Roman,
first of the Christian, encyclopædists. He devotes two sentences
to the small island of Thanet, now a part of Kent. He gives
three sentences to Great Britain; “jet is very common there, and
pearls,” he says.</p>

<p>From works prepared under such conditions one must be content
with a treatise as brief as this in Isidore’s <i>Etymologies</i>:
“The Cynocephali are so called because they have dogs’ heads
and their very barking betrays them as beasts rather than men.
They are born in India.”</p>

<p>The ideal lands, the prodigious races, and the fabulous animals
were first made known to the world by the Greeks. Few
of the classic travel tales, however, originated with them. Most
of them trace back to Egypt and India; if their sources are still
more remote, the track has been lost. The mythical peoples and
animals dwelt in the deserts of Africa and the deserts and mountains
of Asia. India, even more than Egypt, was their home.
The mighty mountains that bordered it, the multitude of peoples
that inhabited it, the strong touch of the grotesque in their art
and ritual, and their curious sense of kinship with the elephant,
the tiger, the snake, and the jackal made theirs the native soil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
of marvel. Many of the singular creatures that peopled the
hinterlands of Africa seem to be emigrants from India and
beyond.</p>

<p>The earliest travel tales in Greek literature are found in
Homer’s Odyssey commingled with accounts of places and peoples
that are not of the earth. These stories of the tenth century
before Christ look westward from Greece. In the poems of
Pindar the strange outlines of eastern marvel appear on the
Mediterranean scene and a new aspect of reality animates them.
With the history of Herodotus, written in the fifth century
before Christ, the invasion is well-nigh complete. Imbedded in
the greatest of all histories, passages about the griffin, the
phœnix and kindred creatures are scattered through volumes that
contain the high story of the Persian attempt upon Greece, and
the best accounts which the Mediterranean world had of the
back lands of the earth. Herodotus had heard of so many wonderful
things which were true that he made it a rule to report
what he heard even where he doubted its truth; and to this rule
the world owes much. The Halicarnassian doubted the existence
of a sea north of Europe, or of the Tin Islands, but he gave them
a place in his pages. He could not believe that the Phœnicians
had circumnavigated Africa, but his record of their incredible
assertion that as they sailed they “had the sun on their right”
is evidence that the thing was done.</p>

<p>Herodotus was attacked as untruthful by Ctesias and the
Pseudo-Plutarch, and his monument at Thurium in Italy recites
that he removed thither to escape ridicule; but in the main this
was the ridicule of men who accepted his pleasant stories and
doubted his history, and who were offended because with too
candid a pen he sketched faction and faint-heartedness in the
Greek states when Xerxes led his host across the Hellespont.</p>

<p>After Herodotus the chief sponsor for antique marvel is
Ctesias the Cnidian, whose work falls in the following generation.
If the one history was the product of travel, the other was
the product of prolonged residence abroad, Ctesias having been
stationed as physician for seventeen years at the Persian court.
He gave the Greeks their first special treatise on India, introduced
the Deformed Folk to the west, and pictured the peninsula
as a preserve of curious peoples and animals. So he made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
a notable book of his <i>Indika</i>, but among the learned it had small
credit. “A writer not to be depended on,” Aristotle calls the
author, and where Herodotus was accused of credulity, Ctesias
was assailed for mendacity. Modern criticism, however, has
identified several of his monstrous races with tribes still inhabiting
Hindostan and partly excused other fables on the
ground that he never saw India and put in his book only what
the Persians told him of their neighbors to the east. When
one people tells another the ways of a third, the theme is
marvel.</p>

<p>What was denied to Ctesias was vouchsafed to Alexander in
the next generation. With his own eyes he saw India. The
European race before which the east unveiled was the most
gifted, curious, and imaginative of all peoples, and the east
beheld it personified in the captivating figure of Alexander.
The expedition brought legends back with it, and left other
legends behind. Indian and Afghan and Turkoman and Arab
never forgot the great Macedonian, while the whole literature of
the west was colored by this eastern contact.</p>

<p>A few other Greek names are linked with the travel tale.
Scylax of Caryanda taxed credulity with his fabric of wonder.
Aristotle examined reports of fabulous creatures, and fables as
to actual species, and rejected most, but not all, of them. The
study of anthropology, developed at Alexandria, found its harvest
in the geography of Strabo and in the survey of the
Erythræan Sea by Agatharcides. Both works contain curious
accounts of curious tribes of men.</p>

<p>Pausanias the Lydian, who lived in the second century of the
Christian era, is better remembered than men with better title
to remembrance, because his work happened to survive. His
<i>Description of Greece</i> has been compared to an old shoe flung
high on the beach of time. An old man wrote it, interested in
old things. Pausanias has much to say of the wonders of sacred
grottos, trees, and springs. His method of taking a road and
describing everything along it was copied by pilgrim writers,
who clogged the paths of Palestine with their marvels. Modern
criticism has discovered that he repeats as interviews with
natives statements he had read in local handbooks, and that,
betrayed thereby, he tells of seeing cities as flourishing places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
which had been in ruins for centuries. Yet Pausanias was a real
traveler, although at times a luckless compiler.</p>

<p>Lucian the Samosatan was his contemporary, but his contribution
to marvel is a satire on the credulity of all travelers, among
whom he arraigns Homer, Herodotus, and Ctesias. His <i>True
History</i> relates an imaginary voyage to the moon, and thence to
the Fortunate Isles, where Ulysses entrusts him with a letter to
Calypso. In the belly of a whale nearly two hundred miles
long, which had swallowed his ship, he finds lakes, woods, and
strange races of living men. It was the singular fortune of this
travesty to provide material for epics which the Celts accepted
as history and for adventures which were foisted on the narrative
of Baron Munchausen.</p>

<p>The Latin mind was inferior to the Greek chiefly in that it
was deficient in curiosity. The Romans were content to rule
the world rather than to understand it. It was enough that
amber and silk and incense and spice should come to them from
the four corners of the earth without their following the trade
routes back to find what manner of people sent these things.
Yet legend was active among the mariners and camel-drivers
and porters of the races that served the Roman on the fringes of
his empire. The fables of these porter-nations were passed on
to the Arab and are preserved in the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>.</p>

<p>Rome, however, performed a service to the traditional world
by producing the elder Pliny and his amazing <i>Natural History</i>.
Pliny has not the charm, narrative gifts, or historical genius of
Herodotus, but he comes half a millennium afterward and has
more to report. He lacks the comprehensive and penetrating
intelligence of Aristotle, but he knows more—of things that are
so, and of things that are not so. His great work is perhaps the
most impressive monument to industry raised by a single mind.
The entire body of learning of the ancient world passed through
his mind and came out again in the volumes which he calls a
natural history but which are in fact an encyclopædia. These
thirty-seven books record twenty thousand matters of importance
collected from about two thousand volumes, only a few of which
have survived. As his nephew, the younger Pliny, recites, it
was his maxim that “there is no book so bad but some good may
be got out of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p>To get it Pliny made notes, even in the bath. When he traveled,
his secretary was by his side with a book and tablets, and
if it was winter the scribe took dictation with his gloves on. In
Rome Pliny never moved about except in a litter, reading while
he was being carried through the streets. Once he rebuked his
nephew for walking and “losing all those hours.”</p>

<p>While tracing the courses of the stars, the description of countries,
plants and animals, the anatomy of man, the properties
of drugs, the nature of gems, the uses of metals, the science of
farming and the fine arts, Pliny contrives also to sketch the
geography of marvel. “It is really wonderful,” he declares,
“to what a length the credulity of the Greeks will go.” Yet he
draws most of his material from them, and whatever his own
attitude toward the things he recites, the result of the recital was
to give credulity its own text-book for a thousand years. Cynical
as was his point of view, Pliny was yet a lover of marvel and
searched it out and set it forth in his pages whether he believed
it or not. It was enough that it was interesting.</p>

<p>His was the journalistic angle. The <i>Natural History</i> is in
effect a vast newspaper report of the world of about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 77.
The columns of curious miscellany which newspapers print
sometimes under such headings as “Oddities in the Day’s News”
are legacies of his spirit. The monument to his immense industry
and reportorial instinct is a work which fabulists of all succeeding
ages used as a quarry for their own building materials.
Had his been the questing mind of the Greek, instead of the
drag-net intelligence of the journalist of an incurious but marvel-loving
world, the view of the central countries of culture
and of the horizon lands presented in the <i>Natural History</i> would
have less the aspect of a main circus tent surrounded by side
shows.</p>

<p>Solinus, surnamed Polyhistor or the Varied Narrator, distilled
the marvels from Pliny, making some seven hundred
extracts, adding to them from other sources, and producing a
work which supplanted the older writer in the affections of the
multitude throughout the Middle Ages. His <i>Collecteanea</i> appeared
in the third or fourth century of the Christian Era, and
although he seems to have been a pagan grammarian, he had
mainly Christian readers. St. Augustine quotes him four times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
in his <i>City of God</i>, and Isidore uses no less than two hundred
extracts in his <i>Etymologies</i>. The pagan’s work was both a symptom
and a cause of the intellectual decline in the Middle Ages.
Other men did as he did, or accepted the results of his labors
as sparing them its pains. What he did, and what Europe did
after the breakdown of the old order of things, was to forget
ancient wisdom and hold fast to ancient wonder. Solinus was
spiritual father of the Christian fabulists, mentor of the Christian
pilgrims.</p>

<p>What Pliny wrote, perhaps with his tongue in his cheek,
Solinus copies with mouth agape. The world is become a playhouse,
a curio hall, a province of faerie. One learns that, like
man, the quail suffers from the falling sickness and that the
cranes of Thrace travel southward in ballast, stuffing their craws
with sand and pebbles. In the Mediterranean islands there is
a “sardonic” plant, on eating which one grins horribly and dies
of lockjaw. In Germany are the Hercynian birds whose feathers
give light in the dark. Here also is a mule-like pastoral beast
with so long an upper lip that he “cannot feed except walking
backward.” In Africa are jovial apes which rejoice in the new
of the moon and lament in its wane, and sphinxes and satyrs
“easily taught to forget their wildness, very sweet faced, and
full of toying continually.” There are no snakes in Ireland—and
no sense of right and wrong.</p>

<p>The <i>Physiologus</i>, an Alexandrian compilation, companions
the <i>Collecteanea</i>, but introduces a moralizing note and thereby
ushers a rabble of real and fabulous animals into the symbolism
of ecclesiastical architecture. Isidore of Seville is a desiccated
Solinus, dried out by theology and the specialized pursuits
of the grammarian. He wrote at the opening of the
seventh century. His <i>Etymologies</i> has already been cited as
that irreducible minimum of knowledge to which the epitomizing
habit of Roman encyclopædists tended always. It shows also
the Roman dependence on authority as a substitute for research,
and the Roman worship of words. Easy it was for early Christian
writers to take up the tradition of the encyclopædists, for
it needed only that the authority of the pagan be replaced by
that of a purer faith. The pagan marvels were accepted almost
in a body and many of them are briefly recited by Isidore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>How words breed legend is disclosed in the very title of the
<i>Etymologies</i>. Carrying a little further the tradition of the
Romans, with whom philology was almost as old as poetry and
more important than natural science, Isidore seemed to think
that when he had given the derivation of a term he had accomplished
a complete description of the thing that bore its name.
Words themselves were things transcendental. Thus he defines
Barbarism as “the uttering of a word with an error in a letter
or in a quantity.” <i>Nox</i>, the Latin word for night, “is derived
from <i>nocere</i> (to injure) because it injures the eyes.” “<i>Homo</i>
is so named because he is made of <i>humus</i> (earth), as it is told
in <i>Genesis</i>.” “<i>Corpus</i> (the body) is so called because being
corrupted it perishes.”</p>

<p>Isidore writes the texts for the chapter in the history of marvel
that deals with Christian fabulism, pilgriming, and cosmography.
It is Christian only in the sense that Christians of the
earlier centuries tell the tales, make the journeys, and construct
the world theories. Its subject matter is Jewish and pagan, with
the two elements sometimes in an artless, sometimes in a forced,
combination; it presents one side of that contact and conflict
between Aryan and Semitic cultures which is the history of the
last nineteen centuries. For the first part of the period the result
of the conflict in the field of geography, travel, and tradition
was what might be expected where simple-witted peoples, lately
emerged from barbarism and not yet nationally minded, meet
a race of ancient culture and intense national spirit. Jewish
conceptions prevailed. It was thought that children, if taught
no other tongue, would naturally speak Hebrew. Europe accepted
as a literal recital of fact the Sumerian legend preserved
in Hebrew Scriptures that the human race began with
Adam—“the mean, toolless and frivolous Adam,” as Andrew
Lang calls him—and his consort in the Garden of Eden; and
from Hebrew chronology it figured that the earth must be about
four thousand years old. It made over its geography to conform
to Old Testament texts, and, discarding the world-knowledge
of the classic civilizations, it made over its maps to show
Jerusalem in the center of a flat earth.</p>

<p>When pilgrims to Palestine had visited the scenes of the birth
and passion of Christ they proceeded to explore the Jewish background<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
for memorials of Old Testament history, with side trips
into the realm of pagan marvel. All of them looked for the
pillar of salt by the Dead Sea in which Lot’s wife was entombed;
for centuries this column comes and goes in their narratives.
Silvia of Aquitaine, whose journey falls in the fourth century,
says there was no pillar there—the sea had engulfed it—but
others saw it later. Theodosius says it waxed and waned with
the phases of the moon. Antoninus denies the report that pasturing
sheep had diminished its size by licking it. A fragment
of this marvel is in the Library of Congress at Washington,
together with the report of an American traveler who measured
the pillar and found it sixty feet high and forty feet around,
larger than he believed Lot’s wife could have been.</p>

<p>Other of the earlier pilgrims are said to have gone into
Arabia to see the dunghill where Job contended with his comforters.
The pyramids, some thought, were the barns of Joseph.
The Apples of Adam still showed the marks of his teeth. The
Jordan halted its waters at the time of the Epiphany. Devils
were seen on Mount Gilboa. The torments of hell lay under the
Sea of Sodom and Abbott Daniel had a whiff of them from its
surface. In Samaria, Paula, friend of Saint Jerome, saw
“devils writhing and yelling in different kinds of torture, and
men before the tombs of the saints, howling like wolves, barking
like dogs, roaring like lions, hissing like serpents, bellowing
like bulls.” One pilgrim writer copied another, few took any
note of the natural features of Palestine, most of them were of
primitive culture, and the women had a wider outlook than the
men.</p>

<p>The Jew, Rabbi Moses Petachia, made a pilgrimage, reporting
among other things that the wind which blew from the shallow
parts of the Sea of Azov, the Stagnant Sea of old geography,
was fatal to passers-by; he saw on the Euphrates a flying camel
which could go a mile in a second. Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela
undertook a remarkable journey in the twelfth century to learn
the condition of the Jewish communities of the east. He brought
back valuable information, but said he could not approach the
vast ruins of Babylon because of the scorpions and serpents that
haunted them, located mythical Jewish states in the deserts of
Arabia, and repeated numerous fables on hearsay. If he ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
took this journey, says the elder Disraeli, it must have been with
his nightcap on.</p>

<p>How the new peoples of the west lost the sense of historical
perspective under the Jewish impact is shown in the long speculation
over the whereabouts of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.
Classic learning was dismissed as “windy babble.” The fate of
the peoples of the great monarchies of antiquity aroused no
curiosity. But everywhere were sought the footsteps of the vanished
Israelites. They were imprisoned in the Caucasus, they
had become Afghan mountaineers, they were privileged subjects
of Prester John, they were settled in the Canaries, they had
reached China, they had colonized Peru, they were the progenitors
of the British and American peoples, they were the ancestors
of the North American Indian, and the first Mormons.</p>

<p>While Europe was curious about the shrines, landmarks, and
legends of Asia, and held it to be the continent of wonder, Asia
did not return the interest. It had few travel tales to tell of the
peoples of the west, few reports of any kind. The Chinese saw
little of note in the Roman Empire, “Great China,” save that
it had good jugglers and asbestos cloth and that the eastern gate
of Constantinople was covered with shining gold leaf and was
two hundred feet high. India ignored the sea, and was self-contained
in its life and legends; the fabulous and felicitous
peoples of the Puranas dwell in trans-Himalayan valleys. Arab
sailors were carriers of Indian fables and may have taught them
to the Chinese; a large part of Chinese marvel has a quality
suggesting importation. Yet the superior historical sense of
the Chinese, preserving almost intact marvel tales that were
brought to them, made the rest of the world their debtor. Their
encyclopædias and classics are quite in the style of Pliny, as,
for example, the <i>Shan Hai King</i>, or <i>Wonders by Land and Sea</i>,
to which the dates of <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 2700, 2205, and 222 have been severally
ascribed, and which is also alleged to be a Taoist forgery
of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> Monster peoples and animals are in
this work, and one of its early prefaces relates the journey of a
king to the Halls of the Giants in the east, to the mansions of
the Fairy Queen in the west, across a bridge of tortoises in the
south and over streets made of feathers in the north. It is also
recited that by imperial decree nine urns were set up in various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
parts of China on which, to the fear of the people, the common
and the strange animals of each region were pictured.</p>

<p>Religious fervor at length set the feet of Chinese upon paths
along which wonder grew. Buddhist priests and scholars went
east to teach and west to learn. If the annals of the Middle
Kingdom are to be credited, a fair interpretation of the record
is that the Chinese reached the coast of North America in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 499 and again in 502 and 556. They found countries
which they described as the Land of Marked Bodies and the
Great Han country. The natives of the former had horses and
draft deer with great horns (reindeer) and esteemed copper
more than gold. A thousand furlongs east was the Kingdom of
Women—erect, white-skinned, hairy, timorous, subsisting on a
salt plant like wormwood. The residents of the Land of Marked
Bodies, supposed to be the Aleutian Islands, were tattooed, joyous,
rich in gold and silver. Eastward was Great Han, possibly
British Columbia, the wild beasts of which devoured guilty
criminals, but spared persons falsely accused. There was also
a country of dog-headed men.</p>

<p>These lands have been identified with regions of northeastern
Asia, and because of their climate and products with American
regions as far south as California and Mexico.</p>

<p>The westward journeys of Buddhist scholars are historical
and important. They went to India at various periods from the
beginning of the fifth to the latter part of the seventh century of
our era to study the Law of Buddha, to visit the sites associated
with Sakya Muni and to collect sacred books and relics. One
Chinese work has a record of fifty-six of these worthies. The
Buddhist pilgrims were men of higher intelligence and still
greater credulity than those who at about the same time were
journeying out of Europe to the shrines of Palestine. Their
largest figure, and one of the world’s greatest travelers, is
Hiouen Thsang, who left China in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 629 and returned seventeen
years later.</p>

<p>In the desert of Gobi, Hiouen saw spectral armies charging
down upon him and at night the flare of spectral torches, but at
a word of scripture the glamour faded. In the T’sung-ling
mountains Fa-hien found poison dragons that spat the storm and
avalanche; here, says Hiouen, one should not wear red garments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
nor carry loud-sounding calabashes. The pass of Varasena was
so high that birds could not fly over it, but crossed the summit
afoot. Report had it that in the deserts of Turkestan a sandstorm
covered in a single day as many cities as there were days
in the year.</p>

<p>The India that Hiouen traversed was a land of ruins and
marvels. He tells of demon women and miracle gold and
wonder-working Buddha teeth; of a shepherd that became a
dragon; of a roe that brought forth a beautiful girl with deer
feet; of a risha that could fly until a princess touched him, and
thereafter he merely walked; of a holy man whose sanctity
made light in a dark wood. There are elephants in his pages
that tend shrines with flowers and perfumes, and wild asses that
protect an altar, and desert ants as large as hedgehogs. There
are dragon domains and serpent palaces underground, and
aboveground a Buddhist tower made of cows’ dung. There is
a City of Hump-backed Women and on a distant island the
Kingdom of Western Women who traffic in gems with Byzantium
and accept lovers from there.</p>

<p>Most of these things of Chinese report the west knows also
from Herodotus and Pliny and Polo. Out of India, marvel.</p>

<p>The Nestorian chapter in the joint history of religion and
wonder bears a twelfth-century date, but deals with the inheritance
of classic fable. Although the mediæval legend of a
powerful Christian monarch named Prester John, who reigned
amid pagan enemies somewhere in the heart of Asia, was based
on rumors of the eastward spread of the Nestorian faith, the
Christian element in it is weighted with all the pagan wonders
of an earlier time. The realm of Presbyter John is the range
of strange animals and stranger men. Thus the apocryphal
letter bearing his signature which reached the west declares:
“Our land is the home of elephants, dromedaries, camels, crocodiles,
meta-collinarum, cametennus, tensevetes, wild asses, white
and red lions, white bears, white merles, crickets, griffins, tigers,
lamias, hyenas, wild horses, wild oxen, and wild men, men with
horns, one-eyed men, men with eyes before and behind, centaurs,
fauns, satyrs, pygmies, forty-ell high giants, cyclopes, and
similar women; it is the home, too, of the phœnix, and of nearly
all living animals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<p>Here, continues the royal letter writer, are the accursed Gog
and Magog, and the Lost Israelites, and the worm Salamander,
and Amazons and Brahmans, and paradise and pearls and
pepper. And when John goes to war a million and a half soldiers
follow him. The epistle is pagan marvel’s broadest
gesture over lands unknown.</p>

<p>With differences of Oriental temperament and cast of
thought, Arab geography and travel parallel every phase of the
west except the Age of Ignorance. The Arabs escaped a Lactantius
and a Cosmas, but they had their Plinies and Ptolemies,
their own sea epic, and in Ibn Batuta a traveler second only
to Marco Polo. Until the Middle Ages were ending the centers
of world culture were at Bagdad and Cordoba. If Christendom
accepted the ancient fables and rejected the ancient learning,
Islam embraced both.</p>

<p>The great Arab geographers blended in their works the
methods of Ptolemy and Pliny, together with a story-telling
strain from the coffee-houses of the east. The very titles of
their works suggest this—Aljahedh’s <i>Book of the Cities and
Marvels of Countries</i>, Massoudy’s <i>Meadows of Gold and Mines
of Precious Stones</i>, Al Istakhri’s <i>Book of Climates</i>, Ibn Haukal’s
<i>Book of Roads and Kingdoms</i>, Ibn Khordadbeh’s <i>Principal
Trade Routes</i>, Abulfeda’s <i>Encyclopædia</i>, and Idrisi’s <i>The Delight
of Those Who Seek to Wander Through the Regions of the
World</i>. These are treatises such as would be expected from
a race which had found its destinies in trade routes, which had
pitched its tents in the seats of the ancient culture, and which
took its ease in coffee-houses. They show Ptolemy’s sense of
distances and measurements, Pliny’s note-taking habits and
appetite for marvel, the bazar instinct for entertaining stories,
and the Arab’s poetic fancy. Massoudy’s is the typical product
of his race. It is a vast and glittering collection of history,
science, travel, and legend, thrown together by an imagination
to which the varied and shifting shows of life and nature were
perpetual delight. What mainly it and its companion works
lack is the Greek sense of form and capacity for precise
thinking.</p>

<p>Arab geography and marvel are best to be studied in the
seven voyages of Sindbad the Sailor. These are true travels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
tricked out with legendary travel tales, taken by a number of
men, notably the Two Mussulman Travelers of the ninth century,
and all ascribed to one man in order to give them the epic
quality. Sindbad is the Arab Ulysses and this the Arab
Odyssey. The theater of the eastern epic is the Indian Sea,
rather than the Mediterranean, it is well-nigh free from myths
of the supernatural, and its geographical notes, although disguised,
are definite. One can trace, and Beazley has done so,
the itineraries of the much-buffeted merchant-wanderer, and
identify the material of many of his adventures.</p>

<p>Wak-wak, the destination of the first voyage, is perhaps
Japan; the island of mysterious nightly music is an echo of
Solinus; the adventure of the whale’s back is repeated by St.
Brendan’s companions, and the owl-headed fish are borrowed
from Khordadbeh. The accounts of the roc of Zanzibar and
the Indian valley of diamonds in the second voyage are to be
found also in the <i>Travels</i> of Marco Polo. The third voyage is
lifted from Homer; the hairy, ugly little dwarfs are the pygmies
of the Iliad, and the one-eyed giant who ate Sindbad’s companions
is a negro Polyphemus out of the Odyssey. The fourth
voyage, with its incidents of cannibal ghouls and their reason-destroying
herbs, the burial of Sindbad alive with his deceased
native wife, and his encounter with pepper-gatherers, is a distorted
narrative of Indian races, customs, and products. The
Old Man of the Sea, or Sheikh of the Seaboard, in the fifth voyage
is the orang-utan of Sumatra. The sixth voyage is mainly
a description of Ceylon. In the seventh voyage the account of
elephants that transported Sindbad to their cemetery, where
without killing them he could have all the ivory he required, is
about as Pliny would have written it.</p>

<p>Into this east of glowing sorceries came two men of the west
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the one to traverse
Asia from end to end, and see more of wonder than any man
had seen before, the other to roam still farther, for his journeys
were in his imagination and had only its limits. The <i>Book of
Diversities</i> of Marco Polo is the greatest of all narratives of
wanderings. The <i>Marvellous Adventures of Sir John Maundeville</i>
is the wildest of all romances that purport to be fact. The
two works may be considered together if for no other reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
than the ironic comment they afford on popular judgments
before time redresses them. The facts of Polo were long
treated as fables. The fables of Maundeville were accepted as
facts. Sir John’s book was translated into every European
tongue and passed through hundreds of editions. Because of
his reports on the wealth of Kublai Khan, Marco was nicknamed
Il Milioni; he was asked on his deathbed if he would not recant
some of the things he had said, and after his death there figured
in Venetian masques a comic character who told unbelievable
tales to guffawing street crowds and was called Marco Milioni.</p>

<p>The Venetian spent twenty-four years in Asia, most of the
time in the service of the philosopher-monarch, Kublai Khan,
and returned to his native city in 1295. There are fables in
his book, hearsay statements usually reported as such; but their
effect of illusion is slight compared with the staggering and
splendid realities which the narrative unfolded before eyes unprepared
for them. Marco drew aside the curtain of Asia. It
was as if the spectators in some provincial theater, used only to
the antics of vagrant mountebanks and the crudities of folk-drama,
saw for the first time one of those extravaganzas of
music, movement, and color, built around a tale of the Orient,
which tax even the dramatic resources of world capitals to produce.
Sitting in their own darkness, the simpler peoples of the
west saw on a stage hung with costly draperies and dim with
clouds of incense, a stage of vast spaces and long perspectives,
the civilizations of the venerable east—India, dreaming in the
sun with its jeweled rajahs and naked fakirs; China, with its
teeming populations, its immense inland fleets, its wisdom and
its riches; Burma, serene amid the clang of its temple bells; the
golden roofs of Japan rising out of cherry blossoms; Tibet,
wrapped in a vision; the Indian Archipelago, with its spices,
pearls, and cannibals. Other figures less clearly defined appeared
in the background—nomads of the steppes, fur-hunting
Samoyeds of the tundras, mountain tribes that pressed their
women upon stranger guests; glimpses even of farthest Africa,
of a Christian Ethiopia, of the Zanzibar of negroes, ivory, and
ambergris, and of Madagascar, past which the sea bore relentlessly
southward.</p>

<p>Of many of these things Europe heard for the first time from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
Marco, of all of them his was the first illuminating report, and
most of them his own eyes had seen. Here Truth is the stuff of
Illusion. Though Marco speaks of dog-faced Andamanese, and
islands of Amazons, and Lop with its evil spirits, and the storm-raising
witches of Socotra, and the roc, it is not on these, but
on his verities, that wonder waits. The center of the wonder is
Kublai Khan, who built the pleasure-dome in Xanadu. Greatly
is he beholden to the traveler, who came to him one morning
out of the unknown. But for Marco, as Masefield finely says,
this lord of lords, ruler of so many cities, so many gardens, so
many fish pools, would be only a name, an image covered by the
sands. Remembrance is with those who see, and write.</p>

<p>Though he did not see, Maundeville wrote. The author of the
volume that bears this name may have seen Syria, but he claims
to have been everywhere. He served the Sultan of Egypt against
the Bedouins and declined his daughter’s hand in marriage. He
drank of the Well of Youth. He served the emperor of China
in his war against Mancy. He took astronomical observations
in the Indian Ocean. He traversed Russia, Livonia, Asia Minor,
Amazonia, Persia, India, Tartary, China, Arabia, Libya, Ethiopia.
One great thing his humility forbade him to essay, and
that was the Terrestrial Paradise. “I was not worthy,” he says.</p>

<p>The fabricator of the Maundeville narrative seems to have
been Jean de Bourgogne, a physician of Liège, who died there
in 1373, long enough after his book appeared for it already to
have won reputation; on his deathbed he was proud to avow his
authorship, though not his imposture. It is to be inferred that
he appropriated his pen name of Maundeville, knight of St.
Albans in England, from the title of a romantic satire by Jean
du Pin published a few years before, in which the writer is conducted
in a dream through a world of allegory by a knight
named Mandevie whose home was on a white mountain—Mons
Albus or St. Albans, as has been suggested. Where the adventures
of Maundeville came from is not in doubt. Friar Odoric, a
great but credulous traveler, had spent fourteen years in Asia,
largely in India and Cathay, and had written out his story on
his return to Italy in 1330. Maundeville, whose book is perhaps
of twenty years later, looted his predecessor so thoroughly that
the friar was deemed the copyist of the knight; Samuel Purchas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
thought that “some later fabler,” like Odoric, had stuffed the
knight’s tale. Maundeville raided also the fables of Solinus, the
forged letter of Prester John, the travels of King Hayton of
Armenia, and the varied lore and legend of all lands and times
collected in the preceding century by the great encyclopædist
of the Middle Ages, Vincent of Beauvais. Apparently he never
heard of Polo.</p>

<p>The bogus knight won a wide and fascinated audience by
throwing his marvels into a tale of which he is the hero. His
own adventures, his travels from land to land, his comments on
countries and peoples, give his book unity, movement, and the
narrative interest which is lacking in the works of Ctesias, Pliny,
Solinus, and their school. Ctesias writes of India, but never
professes to have been there, and Pliny and Solinus sit afar and
look over the world. Maundeville comes out of the library and
crosses the earth, staff in hand, in an earlier, and unhallowed,
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. His is the method, and his almost was the
vogue, of the Odyssey and of the Sindbad saga. The classic
brevity and sterility in recounting mirabilia, he escapes in some
measure, robbing several fables to enrich one. It happened that
an early rendering of his work into English was done when the
island tongue was in a fluid state, and done with such sense of
idiom that he has been called, although falsely, the father of
English prose.</p>

<p>Maundeville is most interesting when he is most audacious,
or when he stumbles most. At Joppa he transposes the figures
of a classic myth, and reports seeing a rib forty feet long of
“Andromeda a great giant,” chained there before Noah’s flood.
The chameleon (chamois?) is “a little Beast, as a Goat.” In
Pathen the giant tortoise of Odoric becomes “a kind of Snails
that be so great that many Persons may lodge them in their
Shells.” The rats in the Isle of Charia are “as great as Hounds
here.” There are wool-bearing hens in Mancy. The manna in
the Land of Job “cleanseth the Blood and putteth out Melancholy.”
Chaldea is a country of fair men and evil women. In
the Pepper Country “the Women shave their Beards and the
Men not.”</p>

<p>The author scatters his mythical islands even over the mainland
of Asia. Yet his sense of the shape and rotundity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
earth was far in advance of his time. In the midst of romancings,
one finds this, the clearest word of his century, and in the
field of exploration the most constructive: “I say to you certainly
that Men may environ all the Earth of all the World, as
well underneath as above, and return again to their Country, if
that they had Company and Shipping and Conduct; and always
they should find Men, Lands and Isles, as well as in this Country.”
For this declaration, for the vision of the Valley of the
Shadow of Death which Bunyan took from him and he from
Odoric, for the delight that his fictitious narrative still conveys,
and for the English prose which is its vehicle, one may half forgive
the physician of Liege his pose of a gouty English knight,
dictating the true story of adventurous years to ease hours of
broken rest, and ending it with a benediction, followed, anthem-wise,
by a chorus of amens.</p>

<p>The remainder of the story of marvel, so far as it is a literary
phenomenon, is a sea tale told by men of the west, for Prince
Henry the Navigator was born a few years after Jean de Bourgogne
died, and with his manhood there opens the era of maritime
discovery. Meanwhile the northwest of Europe had entered
the record with Norse and Irish chapters. Though maps of the
early Middle Ages placed the griffins and the cynocephali in the
north of Europe, the north knew them not. Giants and trolls it
knew, and the Iceland sagas tell of vampires that hid in heaps
of stockfish, and monster men, dragons, and bulls that guarded
a haunted shore. The inevitable compilations came later. The
history of Norway written by Pontoppidan in the eighteenth century
is a brief for Scandinavian waters as the habitat of
prodigious things.</p>

<p>The Celts neither robbed nor traded on the sea, and the very
ports of Ireland were opened by Northmen; yet one of the three
great epics of the deep, the <i>Voyage of St. Brendan</i>, is Irish, and
monks are its heroes. The five Irish <i>Imrama</i> or sea tales, of
which this is the chief, weave a spell beyond any other woven
upon the deep, because they look westward toward hidden continents
that presently were to loom through the mists, and track
with spectral craft the very seas that foamed erelong around the
prows of Spain. Working with bits of old beliefs, as a craftsman
with bits of broken glass, the Celt fashioned an oriel window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
through which he glimpsed the lands of dream. It was
magic like that of Gwyn ab Nudd, King of Faerie, who spread
before St. Collen the semblance of a feast in a great court. “I
will not eat the leaves of trees,” said the saint, and flung holy
water about him, and “there was neither castle, nor troops, nor
maidens, nor music, nor the appearance of any thing whatever,
but the green hillocks.”</p>

<p>Fables of old time which had smoldered through the later
Middle Ages, and which were rekindled by fresh contacts with
classic marvel in the revival of letters, blazed into fierce life in
the age of discovery. When new continents swam into ken, and
hidden empires showed themselves for a moment on distant
mountain sides, only to crash down at the onset of a handful of
adventurous men, nothing seemed incredible. A world which
had denied its own shape awoke to the fact of antipodal lands
and peoples and was prepared to believe anything. The extravagant
things it credited—and herein is palliation for its
credulity—were yet small beside the wonders with which reality
smote it in the face. The prodigious races of antiquity that had
retreated before the traveler seemed at last to have been run to
cover in those parts of the New World whither Spanish explorers
penetrated. South America presented itself as a fulfillment of
classic wonder and a proof of the unity of the human story.</p>

<p>Mythical America was in part a projection of the dreaming
mind of Spain upon the sensitive consciousness of savages.
There are stories that have a way of taking root as soon as they
are transplanted, and by the incorporation of native elements of
accommodating themselves so completely to new surroundings
as to deceive the very men who had loosed them. Hence the
mingling of Old and New World elements in the tales of giants,
pygmies, Amazons, satyrs, and acephalites. The conquistadors
put leading questions, and had the answers they wanted. If
they were deceived, yet there was more of the scientific spirit in
the men who set out in search of Paradise or El Dorado, than
in all the generations of encyclopædists who copied down
incredible things and never went forth to find them.</p>

<p>One may trace the outlines of Mythical America in the journals
of Columbus; in the writings of Peter Martyr and Garcilaso
de la Vega; in the monographs of conquistadors like Coronado;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
in the <i>History of the Indies</i> by Oviedo, which Las Casas unjustly
declares is “as full of lies almost as pages,” and in Hakluyt’s
<i>Principal Voyages</i>, justly called the English prose epic.
For the most fabulous and fascinating picture one turns to
Raleigh’s account of his expedition to Guiana in 1595. It is
at once a collection of mirabilia, a story of adventure, a courtly
address to the “Lady of Ladies” (Queen Elizabeth), a commercial
prospectus, and the brief of a man on the defensive. In its
pages the southern coasts of the Caribbean are as rich in marvel
as the southern coasts of the Mediterranean in the pages of
Pliny.</p>

<p>Earlier travelers had found it well to secure specimens of
ores, plants, and savages as vouchers for their credit among
skeptical stay-at-homes, and the Spaniards took the precaution
of carrying notaries in their ships to attest their statements. In
the eighteenth century a more effective check was developed for
travel tales. The science of criticism superseded the habit of
compilation. The reports of travelers were examined, sifted,
and compared by closet philosophers. French savants like
Buache, Delisle, and Fleurieu challenged the realms of prodigy
and had no answer from them. Humboldt’s great journey into
Spanish America at the end of the century is the recessional.
Through the lands of legend he wends his way, a patient, sometimes
a pensive, observer, and puts Atlantis, El Dorado, the
Amazons and the wild men of the woods to the question. His
report is the most tolerant, suggestive, and illuminating document
in the literature of marvel. Soon afterward began the
scientific study of European folklore with the brothers Grimm
as pioneers.</p>

<p>The remarkable things which the North American Indian had
to tell, most of them, were not assayed until after Humboldt’s
time. Save where the Spaniard had been, they have the undiluted
aboriginal quality; yet a bookish note, which has been
imputed to Viking influence before Columbus, is in eastern
Algonquin and Eskimo sea lore and giant lore. These tales of
the northern continent did not launch expeditions, nor enter the
great narratives of travel, and they have yet to win their indicated
place in literature. There is wonder in them, and poetry,
and the deep reflection of untutored minds; though crude the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
backgrounds and the figures that animate them, they parallel
almost the entire array of legendary lands and peoples which
the classic world assembled. Skillful old story-tellers—“delight-makers”
they were called—told them at night about a dim
fire in the ceremonial roundhouses. Winter was the time, for
then, says Schoolcraft, the strange beings that might be underground
or in the lakes and streams could not hear through the
frozen surfaces the merry tales that the Indian dared tell about
them, and the laughter of the roundhouse.</p>

<p>Rude are these records of a people whose trickster-hero might
be the obscene and ofttimes ridiculous coyote instead of Ulysses;
who spoke of caribou back-fat and not of the lotus, and who had
“the sacred groaning stick” rather than the lyre of Hermes.
Their myth-figures, no demigods of marble perfection, are the
coyote, the buzzard, the hare, the loon, the lizard—in reality the
Indian in his nakedness; and their evil beings are flint people
and awesome rolling skulls. Yet they could see in the stars the
light of lodge fires, speak of the rainbow as the road of the dead,
picture the whirlwind as the dance of a ghost, find a relation
between a gust and the flutter of a moth’s wings, trace the drift
of spirits down the wind, and catch on the throat of the humming
bird a gleam of the fire it stole in a Promethean adventure.
No weary Titan upholds the Indian sky, but in Tlingit story an
old woman stands under the earth with a mighty post and
supports it.</p>

<p>Shape-shifting is at the basis of North American myth, and
the substantial identity of men and animals is proclaimed by it.
“Baalam’s ass,” says Leland, “spoke once for every Christian;
every animal spoke once for the Indian.”</p>

<p>If one marvels how the fabric of fable held together so long
alike in classic and savage lands, one has only to make some
change in a familiar bedtime story told to children. Their protest
is instant; they want the tale as they have heard it. So
do men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c25">Chapter XXV. The Gains of Fable</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> has been well for men that they have been citizens of two
worlds—the traditional world and the world of reality. Whatever
harm they have suffered in either has come from but two
things. These things are fear and selfishness, wherein are all
the frustrations and all the cruelties. The rest has been good.</p>

<p>The myths of fear kept men from sailing west and south.
Until a few centuries ago the imaginary terrors of the Atlantic
and of the tropics hid from them the knowledge that men like
unto themselves lived in all parts of the earth, and that the winds
would waft them to these along smooth pathways of the sea.
The myths of selfishness—the tales that maritime nations told
of evil things in waters and upon coasts which they would close
to the enterprise of others—wrought the same mischiefs that
greed and falsehood work anywhere. They retarded the advance
of learning, restrained the intercourse of nations, and
recoiled at last on the heads of those who invented them.</p>

<p>The gains of fable are writ large in the history of modern
exploration. Error was the guiding star of discovery. A vain
fancy was the most precious cargo of the caravels, as it was the
keenest weapon of the conquistadors. The coasting voyages
around Africa into the eastern world would have been longer
deferred if men had known that the Dark Continent reached so
far to the south. The discovery of America was due to three
stupendous mistakes—the belief that Asia stretched thousands
of miles farther eastward than it does; the belief that Japan was
a thousand miles farther from Asia than it is; the belief that the
circumference of the earth was three thousand miles less than
its true dimension. The total of these mistakes was so great
that the whole of the New World lay concealed within it. Had
Columbus known that he must sail due west for nearly twelve
thousand miles to reach Cathay, he would have foregone his
enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span></p>

<p>Because the Spaniards made marvels the text for launching
expeditions instead of telling or compiling stories, their delusions
as to the Americas of the sixteenth century constitute the
strangest chapter of travel tale. But “he that would bring home
the wealth of the Indies must carry the wealth of the Indies with
him”; the illusory expeditions of Spain had results that were
denied to the more pedestrian adventuring of other nations.
One of these led Cabeza de Vaca across the territory of the
United States from Atlantic to Pacific, as early as 1539. It was
not until 1805, in the Lewis and Clark expedition, that the cooler
advance of the Anglo-Saxon matched this feat. In their search
for illusive golden cities the countrymen of the Cid explored
the mountains and savannas of South America, the American
Southwest, and even the South Seas, and did it all so far ahead
of the English and American penetration of the northern continent
that the story of their adventures was an old tale before the
Saxon had entered the Great Plains, or climbed the Great Divide,
or dropped down to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Such is the service of dreams. They fire the mind and make
the feet of young men restless. The province of wonder has
been to rescue men from their heaviness. They settle down in
one place, and their children and chattels tie them there, but the
nomad in them droops within unchanging horizons and sickens
down in dullness. No report of other lands like their own and
other peoples like themselves will arouse them. They want to
hear of marvels, and every tale of them is a pleasant tale even
if it is of one-eyed cannibal giants, or malignant dwarfs, or
headless men, or the storm-winged roc, or the Swallower of the
West. At least it opens new vistas, and peoples them with
creatures such as cannot be seen at home. So it was that William
of Wykeham instructed the scholars of New College,
Oxford, to occupy the long winter evenings in the Middle Ages
with “singing, or reciting poetry, or with the chronicles of the
different kingdoms, or with the wonders of the world.”</p>

<p>The spirit that leads men to seek distant markets, or dig for
gold in mines, or search for raw materials on the other side of
the earth, is modern, and still only a few have it. Through most
of the story of man it has seemed a better thing to hunt for
hidden treasure, to seek for the Golden Fleece or a golden city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
to set out for the Terrestrial Paradise, to win to the back of the
north wind. Even now, report that a prehistoric monster haunts
a lake in Patagonia, or that an expedition will hunt pirate gold
on an island of the Pacific, stirs pulses that would not respond
to the news that a great coal field had been uncovered in Alaska
or China.</p>

<p>Imagination and curiosity, whence have come most of the
travel tales, have builded where building was needed to fill in
empty places whereon men refused to rear the structures of
reality, or to replace what they tore down. In their passages
from age to age and in their long migrations, men have been
constantly forgetting things, carrying over long stretches of the
sea such memorials of the heliolithic culture as a particular
process of mummification, but not the arts and sciences that had
gone with it. They have discovered lands only to lose track of
them. Authentic notes of distant countries and customs they
would not credit; there has been ignorant incredulity as well as
ignorant credulity. The true things in geography to which men
have shut their eyes are no more than countervailed by the vain
things they thought they saw. The tales of afternoon lands and
the singular peoples of the mountains and deserts widen, if only
with the shifting contours of legend, horizons which had been
narrowed by forgetfulness and a perverse refusal to believe.</p>

<p>Nor have even these tales been enough to satisfy with their
close likeness to realities. Men have played with the thought
of other countries above the clouds or in far-off seas, imagining
things which none was expected to believe, and yet which copyists
repeated and literal-minded men accepted sometimes as
having basis of fact. Such are Plato’s Republic, More’s Utopia,
Campanella’s City of the Sun. Aristophanes pictured a Cloud-Cuckoo
Town, which the birds built between earth and heaven to
bring the gods to terms, and filled it with the trillings and pipings
of feathered creatures. The satirist who wrote of Lilliput,
Brobdingnag and Laputa had read Lucian’s <i>True History</i>. In
Ariosto’s Limbo of the Moon were stored such treasures as time
misspent in play, vain efforts, good intentions, unpaid vows, the
promises of princes, and deathbed alms.</p>

<p>Three of these imaginary countries were sketched with such
fidelity to detail, poetic or grotesque, that they lived in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
thought of men with almost a sense of the actual. Scobellum
was a fruitful land, the people of which went beyond the cannibals
in cruelty, the Egyptians in luxury, the Persians in pride,
the Cretans in falsehood, the Germans in drunken license.
Whereupon the gods turned the drunkards into swine, the
lecherers into goats, the gamblers into asses, the idle women
into milch cows, and the misers into moles. The Land of
Cockaigne was a country of luxury and high feeding where the
houses were built of barley sugar and the streets were paved
with pastry and goods were free in the shops. Fiddler’s Green
is a place where always the fiddlers are fiddling and the pipers
piping, and the dancers dancing; it lies on the other side of hell.</p>

<p>Travel tales that purport to be true have a way of rebuking
unbelief with their half triumphs. Noting only the impossible
items in a tradition, learned skepticism has opened itself to discomfiture
by rejecting the whole. The two outstanding figures
of fable, the pygmy and the Amazon, point the moral. In the
more grotesque forms may be found notes on forgotten history
and on palæontology. Those tales for which no basis of fact
can be discerned are yet projections of the minds of primitive
men on the clouds, seen after the men themselves have dropped
below the horizon, like the red in the sky after sunset. At least
their colors illumine the manuscript of antiquity and the rude
scroll of savagery.</p>

<p>Though fantastic fables were bred thereof, it has been loss
and not gain that the old sense of kinship with the fowls of the
air and the beasts of the field is no more. There were compassions
and tolerances in this imagined relation, with just a hint
of deep insight. Before the brotherhood of man became so
much as a phrase, the brotherhood of all created things was a
fact. Killing for the mere stupid sake of killing had no place
in a world in which men believed that the first men were ants;
in which they made the hare, the coyote, and the raven heroic
figures of their epics; in which they celebrated the piety of the
oryx, the elephant, and the llama; in which they acclaimed the
strength of the lion, the keen sight of the eagle, and the sagacity
of the fox, and in which they spared the bear, the deer, and the
parrot because it seemed to them that these were ancestral folk.
Were these savages farther from the truth than men of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
present day whose interest is not in the lives but in the deaths
of beasts, and who rob the woods and fields of half their beauty
and significance by their senseless pursuit of the pathetic, defenseless,
and yet kindred beings that harbor there? “My sister
the swallow” is the chant of St. Francis. In a better time when
wild life will be cherished and not hunted, it will be remembered
that the dawn-peoples had a vision which was not all
vanity.</p>

<p>The world of reality wears a rich garb that was woven for it
by the world of tradition ages ago. Shifting lands of legend
have become solid ground. There was no island of Brasil, but
the country of Brazil bears its name. There was perhaps no
Antilia, domain of the Seven Bishops, but the Antilles stretch
their veritable ramparts across the Caribbean. The Amazons
are commemorated by the earth’s greatest river. There are
beasts and birds which perpetuate the names of the dragon, the
harpy, the sea horse, the unicorn, the satyr. The pity of the
pelican lives in Christian symbolism. The wisdom of the brute
runs through Æsopian fables and mediæval bestiaries. The
creatures of classic prodigy—the griffins, the phœnix, the dragon—animate
the blazons of heraldry. The ideal lands and marvelous
peoples of ancient story lend a strange beauty to the
romances of chivalry. Half of the appeal of cathedrals is in
the monstrous figures—bestial, grotesque, devilish—which proclaim
from their roofs and buttresses and sculptured walls a
paradox which is no paradox at all, that the sanctuaries of the
spirit are set among the perilous ways of the world. The old
credulities are enshrined in the language of every people, in
the imagery of the arts, and in the bedtime tales that follow the
settings of the sun from station to station around the earth.</p>

<p>These things have spoken neither the last nor the greatest
word they are to utter. The fruitful use of the collections of
savage myth and peasant lore is yet to come, when classic legend
will take its place as but a chapter in the volume of fantasy.
What will be revealed therein is the mind of man in the presence
of the spectacle of beauty and terror which is the world. Here
the themes of poetry, painting, and the plastic arts await a new
treatment. Not so much the councils of the gods, the myths of
creation and of natural forces, as the simpler travel tales that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
are close to the soil will be drawn upon. Olympus towers afar
with its divinities. Nearer to the earth, for example, is the
mountain of San Francisco in Arizona, which the Navahos say
was “bound with a sunbeam, decked with haliotis shell, clouds,
he-rain, yellow maize, and animals, nested with eggs of the
yellow warbler, spread with yellow cloud and made the home
of White-Corn Boy and Yellow-Corn Girl.” However high their
spirit soars, men’s feet are on the ground. If it is the limitation
of their nature it is the liberation of their art that their
interest is more in quests of the Terrestrial Paradise than in
myths of things unearthly.</p>

<p>It was the first belief of man that with a thought he could
change the outer world. What was it, indeed, but the projection
of his own soul—the demons that were his evil thoughts,
“the savage and voluptuous beasts that were the emblems of
his folly,” the ideal lands that were the dawn and afterglow
of his own days? The beginning of art was magic, alike in
the chants of rainmakers, the cave paintings of the Dordogne,
and the sculptures of Egypt; and magic is its end. Still may
the artist soul of man fashion its own realities.</p>

<p>While he builds the pleasant marvels of his yesterdays into
habitations of fancy, he will rear other structures of the like
insubstantial stuff and deem them the abiding places of reality.
The shows of nature are a pageant through which man moves in
a dream of his own making. The piling and passing of the
clouds, the fog’s oblivion, the sunset, the night and the stars,
work their spells about him, masking, concealing, revealing.
With the harmless revel of fireflies in the dew and dusk, fairy
locks unbolt for him. He cannot look upon life save as a drama
or an allegory, with the earth as the stage and the sky for its
hangings. By the law of his being he must be maker of myths.</p>

<p>Only a divine animal could question what was behind the
hills, win the vision of unconjectured oceans, hear the note of
eternity in the sound of running water, and, flashing into a brief
ecstasy, sink back again with the cry of Eheu Fugaces. The
brute-gods of his myths, are they not man himself with his
animal routine and his divine moments? When he crosses the
barrier of dreams, when he sits at the gates of memory, when
contemplation holds him motionless “like a flame in a windless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
spot,” in his Dionysian intoxications, in the very dances wherein
he merges the god and the brute, he creates worlds that ensphere
his every mood. The Iranian who calls the abode of the blest
the House of Song, and the Mongol whose official scrolls speak
of the continents as the Golden Surface have made a new heaven
and a new earth.</p>

<p>It is not given man to envisage reality. His is the greater
gift to brood over Chaos and shape it as he will.</p>

LEVIATHAN      <span class="smcap">By William Bolitho</span><br>
</p>

<p>“If you are a discriminating reader you will have marked William
Bolitho as a man whose stuff you will follow anywhere, for he stands
out from the hordes of excellent and gentle essayists as boldly as does a
woodcut when placed next a half-tone engraving.”—<i>Laurence Stallings</i>
in the New York <i>World</i>.</p>

THE LIFE OF THE BAT      <span class="smcap">By Charles Derennes</span><br>
</p>

<p>An exciting personal narrative is told in this book—the life story of
the bat, much of it threaded on the life experiences of a captive bat
called Noctu. He very soon develops a strong personality, and through
his story we learn the life history of bats generally,—their apparent
pastimes,—as in their aerial ballets—their mating, their search for
food and the whole fascinating range of their daily and nightly activities.</p>

AT A VENTURE      <span class="smcap">By Charles A. Bennett</span><br>
<i>Illustrated by Clarence Day, Jr.</i>
</p>

<p>“How delightful to run across a new writer of such subtle penetration
combined with a light and lazy humor. Mr. Bennett has a fine
sense of satire, of character, of life, and is a master of the luminous
phrase. He discusses live subjects, and his papers cover all sorts of
topics from advertising to zebra-raising, written with ease, elegance
and grace. The pictures are priceless, all movement, irony and
grin.”—<i>W. E. Woodward</i> in the <i>Nation</i>.</p>

THE BIBLE AND COMMON SENSE      <span class="smcap">By Basil King</span><br>
</p>

<p>Here is a book in which honest people of every communion, groping
their way through the storms of controversy, will find fresh light to
guide them. Mr. King tells eloquently what the Bible means to him
as an individual, and frankly and fearlessly discusses such topics as
the Virgin Birth, the divinity of Christ, and the effect of scientific
criticism on the Bible. His tone is always constructive, always reverent,
always inspiring.</p>

<p>What is religion? Has it any real bearing on morality and the unescapable
facts of human relationship? The author of “The Behavior
of Crowds” here scientifically analyzes, in the light of social psychology,
the ceremonials and taboos of religion, and the fundamental meaning
and cause of group religion as a universal human need.</p>

</p>

<p>A spirited and entertaining discussion of the “low-brow” arts and

humor, by a “high-brow” young critic who sees in them the flourishing

<p>A keen analysis of the typical American attitude, as exemplified in

the mystic depths of his own soul.”—<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>
